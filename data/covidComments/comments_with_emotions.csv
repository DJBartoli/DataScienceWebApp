We could not have made this video without experts who took time in one of the busiest periods of their own careers. A huge thanks especially to Dr James Gurney and Dr Max Roser of Our World in Data for helping us make sure the video was as accurate as it could be in a situation that is changing daily.


Also a big shoutout to https://ourworldindata.org/ – the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site.

2020,COVID-19,"Excellent. We in Oregon watched our neighbor, Washington, go through these days. And we ourselves got our first presumptive cases in early March. So we have been taking things very seriously for a while now.  We can attest that social distancing works. I've been in social isolation coming up on six weeks. We will begin to open elective surgeries on Monday and sometime soon we hope to open rural counties who have not seen a lot of cases. Precautions still apply. We may start opening up the urban areas by late May.  We've not seen the typical spike happening elsewhere because we got to it quickly.  But if we open up too soon or not with proper precautions we could be right in the thick of it.  We are all in this together.",joy

I really thought I was going to lose her,  every day was a battle.  For 5 weeks I took care of her,  it was just me,  her and her meds.  She fought it off but it was still a struggle.  Fortunately a month prior to her getting diagnosed,  I had tested positive for covid as well. It was a blessing in disguise as covid did nothing to me but take away my ability to Taste. Anyway what I’m trying to say is that no matter how severe covid can be or how mild covid can be.  It should be taken extremely serious.  Anti maskers are idiots and so are people saying this virus is a hoax.

I consider this to be a mild case as of what I have found and researched, that GI only (no respiratory symptoms) reflect mild cases. thus as the A&E (ERs) are overcrowded, I am riding the cow and staying put at home at least for a full fortnight (14 days). Until now, only Chinese videos (in English) state that diarrhoea can be asymptom just like anosmia or the inability to smell. Thank you again for including diarrhoea as a symptom.",sadness

2020,COVID-19,"Temporary no smell, lasting about 1 or 2 days, pink mucus out of nose. That with sharp pains abdominal area. Slight headache & feeling my nasal stuffy or clogged. I also can taste and sense a sickness.  Oddly, I'm not imagining it. This accompanied by constipation, then diarrhea with watery stool. This in the same bathroom visit. Only one time this happened, just massive rejection from my body. This overall sickness lasted one night. 3 days later I still feel it in my nasal cavity. No typical signs of COVID-19. No fever, no cough, no breathing issues, no temperature. I take no medications at all. I'm 48 F and a smoker. When I experienced this, with those mentioned above I felt foggy & lightheaded. I did though drink plenty of water & ate ginger candy. I took Q-10 just one pill and let it dissolve under my tongue. I chewed fresh wheatgrass raw. I got my smell back and stomachach went away. It took 2 days. I don't know why, but it definitely helped. Oh I also started to smell various aromatherapy oils through out the day. I thought to wake my brain up to smell again. I think it brought my smell back this way. Waiting to be tested just in case & called for a virtual doctor's appointment. This happened 5 days ago, have just slept alot & bigger appetite than normal. I feel well otherwise. My last visit in a doctor's office & hospital was March 13th. I'm a homecare worker. So at risk going in and out of hospitals for the man I was caring for.

The morning after, I woke up at 7, went out to buy some food and over-the-counter meds, went home then took a bath as per disinfection procedures suggest. There on, the pain is still there and I have noticed a small lump on my lower left jaw, close to the area of my aching tooth. Did a couple of chores after then took a nap. I woke up at 3 feeling cold and feverish. My lower left jaw is swollen and I could no longer eat properly as it tends to hurt when applied pressure. I suspect it's an abscessed tooth since the tooth that is hurting is a decayed one. But I am so worried about the fever. Our area is yet to record a positive case.

2020,COVID-19,"So I got it - 
1. The SARS CoV-2 enters the cell through endocytosis through the ACE2 receptor.
2. There, it uses the host cell's RNA to replicate the entered virus into copies of new viruses.
3. The new viruses then release its own exotoxins that infect the host cell and the host cell apoptosizes (dies off), and the new viruses are released to attack new host cells, and then replicate once more, and then kills off more good host cells, and then the replication and more host cell apoptoses happen again - a vicious cycle.
4. ARDS - This is when a severe localized pulmonary cytokine storm caused by overinflammation of the immune system affects the lobes, bronchial tubes, and more often, the air sacs of the lungs, by pulmonary-infiltrate-filled fluid. This blocks severely the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the respiratory system It can worsen with time to respiratory failure, and then sepsis and then septic shock where blood pressure goes dangerously down to severe hypotension, and can lead to TSS (multi-organ failure, including heart failure), which can cause the person to die.",sadness

With a fever and because they told him not to get tested he spread it to our whole family and myself. When I got it I went to my primary care as directed to us from the health department I had to argue with the doctor to get tested! And we waited a whole week to get the results. The clinic was horrible to us. Only cared about getting paid. When I said my brother is terribly sick they only asked for his insurance and when I told them he was uninsured they just quoted how much everything would cost. Over 150 just to be seen and for a flu test first. He couldn’t afford it. We are now being monitored by phone calls from the health Department and dont get the luxury to test the rest of the family, stay in a hospital or get retested to help us know. We are being told if something gets worse call the on call nurse or call 911. They are going to tell us if we don’t have anymore symptoms to wait 3 days after that before we can leave the house for groceries.

People have been telling me that all the vulnerable people just need to stay home while “the rest of us” get on with our lives. Not only is that not feasible (4 in 10 Americans have a condition that makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications), and not only does that ignore the tremendous death toll, but it also doesn’t see the whole picture of what’s being put on hold when this virus continues to run rampant.

That was until 2016, at least, when I finally realized the status quo was beginning to buckle in on itself. Come 2020, and humanity (or at least the small subsection which lives in America) are stuck between a rock and a hard place, with the largest pandemic sweeping across the world since Spanish Flu, and an election that seems like it may scar the nation regardless of the victor. I hope things can return to whatever we call “normal” now, but a part of me knows that this may just be the first part of a new chapter of history.

2020,COVID-19,"Here are the answers to some common questions. Please note that this video is about the scientific basis of mRNA vaccines in general, not about any particular vaccine or manufacturer. This video is not sponsored by anyone and does not represent endorsement of any particular vaccine. The answers below are based on well-known, basic knowledge of mRNA/cell biology and immunology, which can be found in ANY TEXTBOOK. More Q&A may be added later.
Also note: this video was originally intended for our regular audience (med students), so it's more technical. We have a simpler version here: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
For comparison of different vaccines, as well as events of immune response, role of different immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, APC), see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q1: How long the mRNA from vaccine will stay in human body? A: mRNA is very unstable, it is easily degraded by enzymes in our cells (RNAses). Average half-life of mRNA in human is around 10 hours. mRNA from vaccine is expected to stay no longer than a day.
Q2: How long the antigen (translated from mRNA vaccine) is expected to stay in our body? A: Several days. Once the immune system is activated, it will see the cells that carry the antigen as damaged and destroy them.
Q3: So from A to Q2, our immune system destroys our own cells, is that bad? A: No. This is the natural way the body detects foreign antigens, just like when an infection occurs – infected cells display pieces of the virus to alert the immune system and get killed. The difference is that you can control the dose with the vaccine, unlike a natural infection. And the vaccine does not multiply. The number of our own cells that will be killed with the vaccine dose is negligible. The effect is also limited to the cells around the injection site. Note that traditional vaccines also work this way: the antigen delivered by a traditional vaccine is also taken up by some of our cells, it is then broken into pieces and displayed on the surface of the cell to be ""seen"" by the immune system. This is the only way for the immune system to detect foreign antigens. The body will replace the lost cells within several days. For more details see this video: https://youtu.be/osRo-yz1VQ8
Q4: So now the immune system will produce the antibodies, will it ever stop? A: It's the same process that happens when there is a natural infection. So, upon infection or vaccination, antibodies will take a couple of weeks to be produced, the level will peak for about a couple more weeks and then it will go down, no more production. But now the body remembers the virus because some memory cells are left - when you encounter the real virus these cells will produce antibodies again, this time instantly in response – so fast that no infection will occur. If the body does not encounter the virus then, no antibodies will be produced.
Q5: How about side effects? A: All vaccines have side effects, mRNA or traditional. The list of side effects should be available online or at any location that offers the vaccine.
Q6: How mRNA gets into cells? A: It is delivered in lipid covering that will fuse with cell membrane (also consists of lipids) - it's called endocytosis.
Q7: Is this gene therapy? A: No, gene therapy involves replacing your gene with a new one, this vaccine does not touch your genes.
Q8: Can mRNA vaccine change my DNA? See full A in this video: https://youtu.be/XTLYXmgG8DU
Q9: I had COVID and recovered, do I still need the vaccine? A: You probably do not need the vaccine if your infection was recent, at least for now. The question remains is how long natural immunity will last, and how long protection by vaccine will last, we do not yet know the answers. UPDATE: 1 dose of mRNA vaccine in people with previous infection works as well as 2 doses in people without previous infection. Basically: previous infection gives the same immunity as 1 dose of mRNA vaccine.",sadness
2020,COVID-19,"Hey there, nice video, detailed and understandable. When the antigen is displayed on our own cells where it is recognized by the immune system 0:54 I would like to know what will happens as the immune system will start fighting our own cells with this new antigen display on its surface.

2020,COVID-19,"About The Buteyko Method: A Summary of the Pathophysiology of Chronic Hyperventilation by Ira Packman, M.D.

The fact that chronic hyperventilation (CHV) has an effect on the lungs is easily understood and explained. The systemic (whole body) effects however, are physically and physiologically distant from the lungs and therefore are more difficult to understand. The multi-system, wide spread systemic ramifications of chronic hyperventilation are numerous.

These effects are all caused by the initial effect of pulmonary hypocapnia (low CO2) which causes spasm of the airways leading to asthma. The loss of CO2 from the lung on a long term basis causes a compensatory response throughout the body. This concept is called homeostasis which means that the body is always trying to stay in balance and return to its most comfortable state.

A partial list of homeostatic controls would include:
- Constant body temperature
- Constant whole body water volume
- Glucose levels
- Mineral balance including sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc etc.
- Acid base balance (Ph control)

The acid base/Ph control mechanisms are very sensitive and closely controlled, because the Ph of the body affects the function of every body system. It is this system that is activated when patients chronically hyperventilate.

Understanding this concept, we can follow what happens with CHV.

- The lungs continuously blow off too much CO2 causing local pulmonary hypocapnia (low CO2) and arterial hypocapnia.

- The arterial hypocapnia immediately changes the Ph of the circulating blood causing an increase in the Ph (alkalosis).

- The increase in the Ph causes a decrease in the delivery of Oxygen to all the bodies tissues due to the Bohr Effect (In an alkalotic environment, the hemoglobin molecules in the red cells hold onto the oxygen molecules more tightly and will not release the O2 to the tissues).

- The kidneys see the alkalosis/Ph change and know that it must correct the bodies Ph back towards neutral (neutral Ph is a Ph of 7.40). Once CHV becomes long standing the kidneys response becomes an ongoing process in which the kidneys excrete bicarbonate in an attempt to correct the alkalosis which was created by the CHV.

- The net result is a depletion of the bicarbonate buffers due to continuous over excretion of bicarbonate which also causes the loss of electrolytes including magnesium and phosphorous which are lost with the bicarbonate.

- The loss of phosphorous also decreases the production of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) and ADP which are the bodies’ main source of energy.

- This then causes a decrease in the functioning of many organs including the muscles, heart, lungs, bone marrow, immune system and liver.

- These functional changes, coupled with the arterial spasm that occurs directly due to the low CO2 levels in the blood, are expressed in the long term as muscle fatigue, hypertension due to arterial spasm, decrease in the oxygenation of the brain, migraine headaches due to arterial spasm, spasm of the arteries supplying the gut, decrease brain function with memory changes, alterations in the production of proteins and metabolism of lipids in the liver causing elevated cholesterol.

This is just a partial list of the systems, organs and bodily functions which are affected by CHV and the subsequent low CO2 levels in the lungs and blood.

This concept regarding the origins and causes of these diseases is very radically different from the way medical schools teach about these diseases. It is revolutionary and may be too simple for many academicians to accept or understand.",sadness
2020,COVID-19,"So I read some articles saying that a fever of below 38-39°C (depending on article) is an immunological reaction if tampered with might lower the efficiency of the different leukocytes at getting rid of pathogens, and thereby making the use of antipyretics contraindicated for fevers lower than 38-39°c of viral/bacterial origin.

I command you to follow him and to obey his commands, laws, and rules. Then you will live, and your nation will grow larger. And the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take for your own. 17 But if you turn away from your God and refuse to listen, if you are led away to worship and serve other gods, 18 you will be destroyed. I am warning you today, if you turn away from God, you will not live long in that land across the Jordan River that you are ready to enter and take for your own.
19 “Today I am giving you a choice of two ways. And I ask heaven and earth to be witnesses of your choice. You can choose life or death. The first choice will bring a blessing. The other choice will bring a curse. So choose life! Then you and your children will live. 20 You must love the Lord your God and obey him. Never leave him, because he is your life.

In many places is advised to NOT go to get tested if your symptoms are mild so the infected people could be double or triple and the mortality rate much lower. 
I saw studies and stats by countries that tested everyone like south Korea and is expected that the mortality rate would be 1% or less. 0.66%

2020,COVID-19,"The impact of covid 19 is not only a supply side shock, it also includes a substantial demand side shock as well which could have stronger and longer negative effects. Demand shocks may even have a bigger weight compared to supply side shocks in this case. Simply stating that the economic impact of covid 19 is mostly due to a lack of investments is grossly understating the problem. Expectations, risk aversions and decreases in income due to job losses and possible erosion of personal savings and disposable incomes due lack of incomes during shut down all constitute large demand shocks. The closure and bankruptcy of businesses also constitute a demand shock issue as well as their demand for input goods declines. It is therefore inaccurate to say that lack of investments is the underlying problem caused by covid-19 and the resumption of credit would constitute a recovery. That is why governments have been enacting stimulus packages in order to attempt to stem the effects of demand shocks.",ambiguous

we need to increase the capacity in our healthcare system after this

and therefore shorter amount of time for quarantining/lockdowns/isolation
and to make sure our economy is still alive
so we don't have to send out stimulus checks
that appear out of thin air in order to get our company into more debt
and to make sure that cities that thrive on economies such as tourism
won't get hit so bad so that the cycle of poverty doesn't hit so many people

2020,COVID-19,death toll today is much higher than when this was made (not published - made) .. as we have now topped 2000 death and 75000 cases (621 now confirmed as infected on the cruise ship docked outside Japan!) singapore 84 cases as of 3.30pm GMT.. they mention 1200 death at the end of the doc .. it does take time to make a documentary !  I really like the singapore gov for their transparency and the emphasis they place on informing their citizen accurately. YOU GUYS ROCK! I am worried to read in respected medical publications that the SARS vaccine research had showed a success in the creation of a vaccine but when injected in animal they had a virulent autoimmune response on re-infection which means we are FAR from a vaccine for sars .. and therefore it may take longer for the Novel COV 2 (Covid 19) too..

I am writing to kindly urge you to recognize the impact that slaughterhouses have on the spread of pathogens (i.e. COVID-19) and request that they cease operation.

This is certainly plausible considering the amount of blood, feces, and other forms of waste the markets' animals typically live in. According to associate professor at the University of Houston Peter Li, ""The cages are stacked one over another. Animals at the bottom are often soaked with all kinds of liquid. Animal excrement, pus, blood."" In addition to COVID-19, meat production and consumption have been linked to conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, avian flu, swine flu, SARS, HIV and Ebola.

We would do drills with shaving cream. It is easier to understand how contamination is spread and how important it is to decontaminate. Try getting out of your PPE without getting shaving cream on you is easier said than done. 

They really needed to zone areas, but did not have the training. I feel in the case of the diamond princess it was the ventilation system as well as the improper decon of items that caused the spread in aerosol form and it kept re-infecting people. There was a case study done on a family from Wuhan had gone to a restaurant in Southern China and it was the ventilation system that caused people at other tables to get infected.

It was the first evidence outside China of how infectious the virus is; double that with the general idea of cruise ship being a petri dish of bacteria and viruses. I remember very well how cases started popping up in more countries all over the world, mostly in Asia first, soon after this cruise ship. It's as if this cruise incident finally wakes us up to the horror of the reality that this virus has a high potential to cause a pandemic. I don't just sympathize with it anymore, I can still remember the chills running down my spine during those months, every morning, when I woke up to another dreadful news about the virus.",sadness

2020,COVID-19 News,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.
“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".
(Matthew 23 NIV)

You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

""Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway"", we can use google search.
These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

In the New Heaven and New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.",joy

6/15/20: The US FDA has officially revoked its Emergency Use Authorization which allowed US doctors to prescribe hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19, stating that the drugs are ""unlikely"" to be effective and, given the potential for serious side effects, the potential benefits no longer outweigh the risks. More information about the revocation can be found here: https://www.fda.gov/media/138945/download; https://www.fda.gov/media/138946/download
6/5/20: 1) The large study which prompted the WHO to remove hydroxychloroquine from its Solidarity trial has been retracted after the authors could not verify the data they obtained and analyzed for the study. The authors' explanation for retracting the paper can be found here: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31324-6/fulltext
6/5/20: 2) A trial testing the use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment has concluded the drug is not effective at preventing COVID-19. Read the paper here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2016638 
5/26/20: Due to rising safety concerns, the World Health Organization has stopped administering hydroxycholoroquine in its global Solidarity trial for the time being. The decision was announced at a press briefing on Monday: https://youtu.be/g3biL-YDyAk?t=984
5/22/20: A global trial with over 96,000 participants has found no clinical benefit from hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, either alone or with antibiotics. Instead, the drugs appeared to increase a person’s likelihood of dying and cause heart problems.

4/21/20: Additional trials have begun reporting results, and so far, they’re not looking promising. For example, a US trial reporting results in a preprint found that hydroxychloroquine didn’t speed recovery, and may have even made things worse: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1.full.pdf
4/8/20: On April 8th, the American Heart Association put out a statement of concern regarding the heart-related side effects of using antimalarials for treating COVID-19 patients. In it, they note that the drugs can cause potentially-fatal changes to heart rhythms, and that these may not be detected in time. You can read their full statement here: https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047521",sadness

2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"Hey Ninja Nerds, wanted to clarify an additional point in the video for you Immunology Nerds!!! Cytotoxic T cells don’t Directly stimulate B cells to become plasma cells and make antibodies, it's indirectly through those cytokines. Cytotoxic T cells cytokines like IFN's stimulate macrophages increasing expression of MHC II complexes which activate T helper cells which stimulate B cells to turn into Plasma cells and make more antibodies.Wanted to make sure it’s clear how Cytotoxic T cells are indirectly involved in antibody production, even though it's primarily the T helper cells that stimulate B cells to make antibodies.",joy

( Be Just )

Quran 5:8..
'' O you who believe! stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the > HATRED OF OTHERS TO YOU < make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. ''

Quran 4:58
 '' Indeed, God commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which God instructs you. Indeed, God is ever Hearing and Seeing.''

( God's The Rules Of  War )

Quran 2:190
'' Fight in the way of God > THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU < but do not transgress. Indeed. God does not like transgressors. ''

Quran  2 :193 

 '' And fight them on until there is no more oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression. ''

Quran 4:90
 ''.........So if they withdraw from you and cease their hostility and offer you peace, in that case Allah has not granted you permission to fight against them.''

Quran 8:61
''And if they seek peace, then you also seek it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.''

( Stand Up For Justice )

Quran 4 :135
 '' Ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against > YOURSELVES < or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.''

( Who Are The Good Human Beings? )

Quran 2.177
'' Righteousness is ""NOT"" that you turn your faces ( In Worship ) toward the east or the west but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth,> IN SPITE OF LOVE FOR IT,< to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for > freeing slaves < [and who] establishes prayer and gives charity; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous. ''

( Freedom To Believe And To Reject )

Quran 2:256
'' Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error ''

Quran 10:99
'' And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed > all of them entirely < Then would you compel the people in order that they become believers? ''

( Tolerance For Other Religions )

Quran 109: 1- 6

Say,""O disbelievers,

I do not worship what you worship.

Nor are you worshipers of what I worship.

Nor will I be a worshiper of what you worship.

Nor will you be worshipers of what I worship.

For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.""

( Protection for Idol Worshiper )

 Quran 9:6
 ""And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are people who do not know. ""

Quran16:125
“Call people to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good teaching, and argue with them in the most courteous way”

Quran7:199 “Be tolerant....”

( Friendship With Non Muslims )

Quran 60:8
'' God does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, God loves those who act justly. ''

( Do Christians And Jews and  ""OTHER"" non-Muslims go to Heaven? )

Quran 2:62
'' Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,-> ANY <- who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. '' ---> { On Judgement Day }

( According to the Quran Christians and Jews worship TRUE God )

(Quran 3:113-114)
'' Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book ( Christians and Jews ) are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.''

Note: According to the Quran that Jesus is not God nevertheless Christians still worship one '' TRUE '' God.
 
( > Allah < Is The Protector Of  Monasteries, Churches, Synagogues And The Mosques )

Quran 22:40
[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, ""Our Lord is Allah ."" And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.

( Why  Are There So Many Different Religions In The World ? )

Quran 5 48
''...... If God wanted He could have made all of you a > single nation < But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you;(scriptures) therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to God; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you > DISPUTE <.''

NOTE:
Quran 3:85
''If anyone desires a religion other than Islam ( > submission < to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (Salvation)''

My explanation of above verse

Islam mean > submission < to God

( The above verse saying is that God will not accept a religion from the > MUSLIM < and the Non-Muslims but total > submission < to God.)

Question: How Can Muslim And the Non-Muslim > submit < to the God?

Answer: Be kind to other human beings and Do not lie, Do not steal, Do not cheat, Do not hurt others, Do not be prideful and Do the charity work.

 ( God Allow Muslims To Marry And Eat Food From the Christian And Jew And Vice Versa )

Quran 5;5
''This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.''

( Kindness Toward Atheists / > APOSTATE < )

Quran 60:8
'' As for such [ of the unbelievers ( atheist) ] as do not fight against you on account of [your] faith, and neither drive you forth from your homelands, > Allah < does not forbid you to show them > kindness < and to behave towards them with full equity: for, verily, Allah loves those who act equitably. ''

( All The Terrorists / Killers Will Enter Hell Fire )

 Quran 5:32
""......Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely......""

( Turned Your Enemies Into Your Best Friends )

Quran 41:34
""The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity (will become) as though he was a bosom friend.""

( The Husband and  The Wife Are > Protecting Friends < One Of Another )

Quran 9:71
''And the believers, men and women, are > Protecting Friends < one of another; they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they pay the poor-due, and they obey God and His messenger. As for these, God will have mercy on them. Lo! God is Mighty, Wise.''

 Quran16:97
  “To whoever, male or female, does good deeds and has faith, We shall give a good life and reward them according to the best of their actions. 

 Quran 30:21
  “And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you > affection and mercy <…”--> { Love }

 The Prophet Muhammad said, “Heaven lies under the feet of your mother.”

( Human Are One family )

Quran 49:13
"" O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).""

( All The Racist People Will Enter Hellfire )

Quran 30:22
 ""And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.""

My comment:

The > BASIC < message of God to the human is that '' YOU '' believe in God and be kind to other human beings / > animals < and in the > RETURNED <  God will  > REWARD < you with a new life in Paradise.

* The Quran ONLY guides you how to become a good human being ""Nothing Else"".

* You are a good  human being or a bad human being that is YOUR choice.

* No one can force you to become a good human being.

* You MUST work HARD to become a good human being.

* Why  should ''YOU'' do good deeds and avoid bad deeds?

* Do Good - it's for You. Do Bad - It's against you.

* '' YOUR'' life is a TEST from God that you will choose to do either Good or Bad.

* Find the excuse to help others and forgive others NOT the other way around.

* '' YOUR '' final destination is either Hell or Heaven.

* So work HARD toward choice of  YOUR destination.

Quran 17:7

2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,Dr Seheult treated one of my family members at our local hospital. He is such an upstanding and competent pulmonologist. I had actually been watching his Med Cram videos for years prior to meeting him in person at the bedside of my aunt. It was a serendipitous moment to know that this wonderful doctor lives and practices in my neck of the woods. My aunt fought valiantly but the infection was too powerful for her to prevail.

2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"Prof Seheult, thank you for your excellent videos. I have a technical question that perhaps you or someone else can answer. I'm not too nervous about having mrna injected into me as part of a tested vaccine because mrna has a short half life and will soon be gone. But DNA is very stable and could remain in my body for years or even for the rest of my life (am I correct about this?). Will this injected DNA keep on producing spike proteins for months or even years? If not, why not? Might this cause my body to have a continuous, albeit low level, immune response to these spike proteins? It seems to me that this could have negative effects. I couldn't find anything directly addressing this by using Google search. Do you have any thoughts on this? Very respectfully, Mark.",joy

Once a population receives these vaccines through mass inoculation, how does the medical community discern the difference between a false positive for the active SARS-COV-2 after the RNA marker are/is present in the human population?

( Be Just )


Quran 5:8
'' O you who believe! stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the HATRED OF OTHERS TO YOU make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear God. For God is well-acquainted with all that ye do. ''


Quran 4:58
 '' Indeed, God commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which God instructs you. Indeed, God is ever Hearing and Seeing.''


( God's The Rules Of  War )


Quran 2:190
'' Fight in the way of God THOSE WHO FIGHT YOU but do not transgress. Indeed. God does not like transgressors. ''


Quran  2 :193

'' And fight them on until there is no more oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression. ''


Quran 4:90
 ''.........So if they withdraw from you and cease their hostility and offer you peace, in that case Allah has not granted you permission to fight against them.''


Quran 8:61
''And if they seek peace, then you also seek it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.''


( Stand Up For Justice )


Quran 4 :135O
 '' Ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as against YOURSELVES, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for God can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.''



( Who Are The Good Human Beings? )


Quran 177
'' Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in God, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, IN SPITE OF LOVE FOR IT, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives charity; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous. ''


( Freedom To Believe And To Reject )


Quran 2:256
'' Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error ''


Quran 10:99
'' And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed - all of them entirely. Then would you compel the people in order that they become believers? ''


( Tolerance For Other Religions )


Quran 109: 1- 6

Say,""O disbelievers,


I do not worship what you worship.


Nor are you worshipers of what I worship.


Nor will I be a worshiper of what you worship.


Nor will you be worshipers of what I worship.


For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.""


( Protection for Idol Worshiper )


 Quran 9:6
 ""And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are people who do not know. ""


Quran16:125
“Call people to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good teaching, and argue with them in the most courteous way”


Quran7:199 “Be tolerant....”



( Friendship With Non Muslims )


Quran 60:8
'' God does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, God loves those who act justly. ''


( Do Christians And Jews and  ""OTHER"" non-Muslims go to Heaven? )


Quran 2:62
'' Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,->ANY<- who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. '' ---> { On Judgement Day }


( According to the Quran Christians and Jews worship TRUE God )


(Quran 3:113-114)
'' Not all of them are alike: Of the People of the Book ( Christians and Jews ) are a portion that stand (For the right): They rehearse the Signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration. They believe in God and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all) good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous.''


Note: According to the Quran that Jesus is not God nevertheless Christians still worship one '' TRUE '' God.
 

( Allah Is The Protector Of  Monasteries, Churches, Synagogues And The Mosques )


Quran 22:40
[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, ""Our Lord is God ."" And were it not that God checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of God is much mentioned. And God will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, God is Powerful and Exalted in Might.


( Why  Are There So Many Different Religions In The World ? )


Quran 5 48
''...... If God wanted He could have made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you;(scriptures) therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to God; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you '' DISPUTE.''


NOTE:
Quran 3:85
''If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (""submission"" to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good)''


My explanation of above verse


Islam mean ""submission"" to God


( The above verse saying is that God will not accept a religion from the ""MUSLIM"" and the Non-Muslims but total ""submission"" to God.)


Question: How Can Muslim And the Non-Muslim ""submit"" to the God?


Answer: Be kind to other human beings and Do not lie, Do not steal, Do not cheat, Do not hurt others, Do not be prideful and Do the charity work.


 ( God Allow Muslims To Marry And Eat Food From the Christian And Jew And Vice Versa )


Quran 5;5
''This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture ( Christian and Jew) before you, when you have given them their due compensation, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.''


( Kindness Toward Atheists / Apostate )


Quran 60:8
'' As for such [of the unbelievers( atheist)] as do not fight against you on account of [your] faith, and neither drive you forth from your homelands, God does not forbid you to show them kindness and to behave towards them with full equity: for, verily, God loves those who act equitably. ''


( All The Terrorists / Killers Will Enter Hell Fire )


 Quran 5:32
""......Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely......""


( Turned Your Enemies Into Your Best Friends )


Quran 41:34
""The good deed and the evil deed are not alike. Repel the evil deed with one which is better, then lo! he, between whom and thee there was enmity (will become) as though he was a bosom friend.""


( The Husband and  The Wife Are > Protecting Friends < One Of Another )


Quran 9:71
''And the believers, men and women, are > Protecting Friends < one of another; they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they pay the poor-due, and they obey God and His messenger. As for these, God will have mercy on them. Lo! God is Mighty, Wise.''


 Quran16:97
  “To whoever, male or female, does good deeds and has faith, We shall give a good life and reward them according to the best of their actions. 


 Quran 30:21
  “And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy…”


 The Prophet Muhammad said, “Heaven lies under the feet of your mother.”


( Human Are One family )


Quran 49:13
"" O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).""


( All The Racist People Will Enter Hellfire )


Quran 30:22
 ""And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.""


My comment:


The '' BASIC '' message of God to the human is that '' YOU '' believe in God and be kind to other human beings / animals and in the RETURNED God will reward you with a new life in Paradise.


* The Quran ONLY guides you how to become a good human being ""Nothing Else"".


* You are a good  human being or a bad human being that is YOUR choice.


* No one can force you to become a good human being.


* You MUST work HARD to become a good human being.


* Why  should ''YOU'' do good deeds and avoid bad deeds?


* Do Good - it's for You. Do Bad - It's against you.


* '' YOUR'' life is a TEST from God that you will choose to do either Good or Bad.


* Find the excuse to help others and forgive others NOT the other way around.


* '' YOUR '' final destination is either Hell or Heaven.

.
* So work HARD toward choice of  YOUR destination.

3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,

5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)

6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.

14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;

15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;

16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.

18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:

5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.

7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:

11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:

12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.

13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;

17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:

18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:

1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)

3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.

4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;

6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.

10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;

15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:

22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"Please, answer this question as it seems to be really important.

So those mRNAs will help to produce the viral spike protein. This protein mostly will be placed on the surface of the manufacturing cells.
And the doctor said that they still don't know for sure in which cells the RNA will enter.
I wouldn't be happy seeing my muscle cells displaying the spike protein being attacked by the immune cells, but even worse, what about nerve cells and other vital cells that are not able to reproduce themselves so quickly?

So important!",joy
2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,30:00 is very encouraging but I still worry about the long term (5 years and more) effects on our bodies. The other vaccines wern't RNA based.  We're only learning how these cells work ... I suspect it's way more complex than we understand now .,joy

2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,My concern is what happens if the immune system sees a single type of cell creating proteins it considers a foreign body. Will it cause an autoimmune reaction.

2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"Great interview!
@27:20  ok so since we dont know how long natural immunity lasts from covid19 patients who have recovered, and we also dont know how long vaccine immunity lasts, maybe we should let those who have already recovered from the virus be a control group to find out how long natural immunity lasts  compared to the vaccinated people, so we can use this statistic going forward.",joy
2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"Great video, a lot of great explanations and detailed understanding about the immune system offered in this video. Of the topics covered, the most important would be the explanation of the long term effects. What is the reason why if by two months that there are no foreseen negative effects? What statistical data exists to demonstrate “two months” as a credible benchmark to understand long term effects?",sadness
2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"So the longterm effects are felt to be known after 2 months.  Someone help me understand how that works?  How would we know if it wouldn't affect reproductive health?  or cause cancer?  Please understand, if this is an experimental vaxxine, long term effects might take a long time to affect us negatively, no?
Would this channel be willing to have a specialist who doesn't work for a vaxxine development company, give a different view?",sadness
2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"I appreciate that the interviewer (Kyle Allred) did his homework and is asking intelligent relevant questions that Professor Crotty can easily answer. It seems that, more often than not, interviewers really don't bother to learn anything before speaking to the expert so many of their questions are so general or vague that the expert has trouble constructing a useful answer. I found this very helpful in understanding this vaccine.",joy
2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"Kyle, Dr.Seheult - I can't thank you enough for your dedication to presenting factual medical information about this virus, covering complex topics with easy to understand explanations.

1) Will the cells that receive mRNA get decimated by CTL cells or NK cells?
2) Why not use a Mannose Binding Lectin to trigger a complement cascade against the viral glycoproteins? 
3) Will nutritional status affect the efficacy or harm of vaccines?
4) Could a mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein create a risk of ADE in vaccine recipients?
5) Can a cruelty-free vaccine be developed?
6) Have glass shards been removed from vaccines stored in glass vials?

Not only has this affected you personally but I can vouch for what you said about patients choosing imported vaccines over domestic, there is no trust in the local vaccines, in fact there's little trust in any local company when it comes to health other than TCM, remember the milk powder scandal? Ask any Chinese parent if they're willing to risk feeding home-grown infant formula to their babies? Or if they'd give their Children locally made vaccines, 100% of the time their answer would be no",joy

Honestly, we give out dogs imported vaccine, buy them imported dog food and formula. If there is an import option from the West, most people, if they could afford it, they will always go with import. 
That's how little faith the people actually have in the government and country, especially after the posioned baby formula that killed potentially thousands upon thousands of babies.

Psalms Chapter 10
2 Through the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued, they are taken in the devices that they have imagined.
3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and the covetous vaunteth himself, though he contends with YAHUAH.
4 The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require'; all his thoughts are: 'There is no God.'
5 His ways prosper at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
6 He saith in his heart: 'I shall not be moved, I who to all generations shall not be in adversity.'
7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
8 He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; in secret places doth he slay the innocent; his eyes are on the watch for the helpless.
9 He lieth in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him up in his net.
10 He croucheth, he boweth down, and the helpless fall into his mighty claws.
11 He hath said in his heart: 'God hath forgotten; He hideth His face; He will never see.'

Proverbs Chapter 21
29 A wicked man hardeneth his face; but as for the upright, he looketh well to his way.

2020,COVID-19 Vaccines,"My Aunt who is a lift driver picked up a man about 3 to 4 months ago, and he started saying he was working at a hospice and 8 of the elderly people he was taking care of got covid about 3 of them died and the other 5 lived and he wasn't being mean but he was wondering how they did live although they were dying.
Edit: (I wasn't done typing, I accidentally did that) 
How'd they survive although they were dying? Well as some people stated, your body signals whose white blood cells and antibodies are basically rushing to the 'area' to fight infections, but while it's doing that, think of your body as a virus, one side is clean and the other is all gross (go with it I don't know any way better to say it) while one side is trying to stop the virus from spreading there's a (let's call it a ""feather"" that ""feather"" also tries to help kill the virus but it also starts to get rid of your health side, it makes you very sick because that's like your health line and that ""feather"" is killing it along with the virus, it doesn't mean to but it will kill anything that's in it's way. Although this might not make sense, your healthy side is being killed off like the unhealthy side, and your body can't reproduce (let's call this a ""egg"") or a small round molecule. 
Those don't reproduce fast enough to actually keep you alive, or at least some people have a strong immune system than others, but you have to think about this carefully, all those elderly people where dying and think about their immune system 5 remained while 3 died, that leaves you with a 1% out of a 100 dying each day. But from what it seems now it looks like a 4% at of 100.",sadness

China's strict control on its citizens actually won some time for the world to prepare for the COVID-19. Meanwhile, the WHO was advocating in various channels that the countries should be get 100% ready for the outbreak in other countries. However, neither EU nor most of the countries were taking actions before the outbreak in their countries. I guess the reason is to avoid panic and the potential economical recession. That's actually the same for China in early Jan. When the virus was seeding, the 1st reaction was to protect people from getting panic and hope not to influence the economy. However, no one hopes it will become a pandemic at the end. That's just human nature from my perspective.

*At the time of this comment (7 hours into the day), there is 11% growth today, but that will likely increase as new cases come in.

2020,Pandemic,"everyday on public transportation, I run into people who coughs and sneezes into the air without masks.. covid-19 can be airborne for up to 3 hours just so you know..
people in the Western world are told not to wear masks only because you don't have enough for everyone.. and you cannot find masks anywhere
often times, when you line up for groceries, you have the risk of getting infected if someone coughs in your peripheral
And what if you happen to run into people who are asymptomatic i.e. bank teller, postal services, you can't keep your 2m distance, and you are breathing in their breaths..

eventually in a few months, everyone has to get back to work.. people need to be in these public areas safely, with masks and proper hygienic education
all it takes is one covid-19 patient coughing through public transportation and shopping centre (thinking it's just a mild flu), and hundreds if not thousands of people can get infected in a matter of days..

Isn't the right strategy to ramp up mask productions and teach everyone how to properly wear masks, just like how you teach people to properly wash their hands for 20 seconds?",ambiguous

Do your job, this is 2020, and we have so many resources to make these things, and other ideas work if The Who, and governments would put in the dedication to find sound ideas that work.

2020,Pandemic,"This guy was not qualified, please get him out of WHO !",sadness
2020,Pandemic,"Yes, its easy to say in hindsight that the WHO should of declared this months ago. I wish they did too, they could of encouraged a lot of countries and their govt/people to take this a lot more seriously and severely limited the spread. But at the same time I agree it was not a Pandemic in January, it simply HAD THE POTENTIAL to be one. Had they overreacted, they may have also been criticized for disrupting economies unnecessarily. When a lot of people depend on you for accurate information, it can be tricky to get it right. Perhaps they could have further emphasized the POTENTIAL of this virus because obviously everyone knew it was on the verge of becoming an official Pandemic even 2 weeks ago. Again, easy to say in hindsight, but I saw a lot more people out and about enjoying their life back in January.

Further, the definition of the word 'pandemic' is a bit vague so different groups feel the word means different things. For example, in Greek, pandemos which is the word it is based on, can be split into pan (all) and demos (people). As of this comment ~125k people in the world confirmed cases (likely a lot more due to imperfect testing), out of 7 billion+ people in the world. Assuming 100k, this is 1 in 70,000 people infected. Under this definition, not everybody will agree this is a pandemic, so clearly the definition varies.

I understand people are concerned as I am, but at times like this it is important to encourage people not to panic, and simply do what we can to control the spread. That includes washing hands, avoiding crowds, avoiding direct contact with other people, and staying at least 2 meters away from someone that coughs or sneezes without covering their mouth (more if indoors, or if windy, etc. use common sense). Even if you don't care about yourself, getting infected raises the possibility that you will transmit it to somebody else, so each and every human being on this planet should do their best to avoid getting this virus.",sadness

2020,Pandemic,"Hong Kong being attach to south of mainland China, we discover a few coronavirus cases in early Jan, the government immediately exercise contact tracing and isolate all infected person, public are told to work from home and school were closed and full distancing were implemented. The government restrict border control by initially introducing 14 day self quarantine when arriving HK and as spread increase around the world, the government now introduce 14 days quarantine in government set up isolated facilities. Currently, people in HK are mostly back at work and school are planning to reopen in April, people are slowly going out with health hygiene caution in mind. We have approximately 115 cases, with 2 dead, over 52 cases recover and recently we had a few inflow cases. So HK is one of the good example for country to show this virus can be contain, surely people of HK lives and economy were greatly disrupted and damage but a short time of sacrifice to gain a long term health is a no brainier. Lastly, both Hk private and most public hospital and clinic are relatively empty. People are not going to hospital for minor sickness. It takes leadership and people to work together.

Maybe put on white gloves. Which will remind you every time you touch your face, because it is foreign. 
Or: put chilli oil on your finger tips. So you will burn your face if you touch it. 
Or, Mark your hands with charcoal, then you will see what parts of your face you touch and you work on ways to prevent yourself from doing so.
Another way to prevent touching your face: like we do to animals. I'm thinking dogs: the collar than prevents hands from reaching the face. I think they call them Elizabethan collars.",ambiguous

2020,Pandemic,"Hi, this is Jonah, the producer of this piece. So what prompted this video? When the pandemic hit, I wanted to learn as much as I could about WTF was going on. So I read some books. I attended some virtual conferences. I went to a congressional hearing on the origin of Covid-19. And I talked to a variety of experts, some of whom appear in our video. One thing, that really stuck out to me was learning that there are more and more infectious diseases emerging over time. Tens of thousands of people were dying in the city I live in and around the world. And I couldn't escape the fact that the data was pointing toward more Covid-19 like events, not less. I made this video as a kind of ""red flag,"" with the hope that people would be able to understand how this pandemic is connected to bigger trends and we are all part of it. There's a short essay that goes with this that you can find here https://nyti.ms/3jyuG8S. It talks about blame and personal responsibility as it relates to pandemics.

I'm probably wrong, but just genuinely curious.",fear

2020,Pandemic,The solution is simple but harder to implement. Most pandemics have originated from our reliance on farming animals. This setup is only going to get worse with more numbers and antibiotic resistant bacteria are already on the horizon. The solution is to move away from our reliance on animal meat for nutrition purposes. The implementation is going to get harder because it affects our human constructs of traditions and identities since a large part of it stems from what we eat.,joy

The only things we could do is to mitigate these future pandemics through experience and investment in public health & infection control, and more research on viruses so we have similar vaccines that have already passed clinical trials, that we could use as groundwork for rapid research. Also better, more comfortable masks, like the ones in the movie Avatar.",joy

2020,Pandemic,"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure comes to mind. Pulling funds for research in foreign countries where viruses may emerge and shutting down the pandemic response team in the U.S. were big mistakes and very short sighted. Of course at the rate we're going in another 50 years the natural world will be so decimated there will likely be few wild animals left on the planet.

An old proverb applies here, ""He who does not learn from history shall be forced to re-live it"".  Right now, we are re-living history.  There is much that could have been learned from the Spanish Flu as how to respond to it in the early stages.  Of course there is no way to know what type of equipment will be needed until the virus is identified, however early testing and quarantining of those can slow the spread.  Just remember, history is repeating itself.   While the coronavirus is being touted as unprecedented, it is true as far as living memory is concerned, it is by no means true as far as world history is concerned.",sadness
2020,Pandemic,"The origins of Spanish flu are very controversial, with lots of theories. However, it must be said that many believe it did actually originate in eastern Asia. Many such viruses do because of the very heavy population density and the close proximity of people to animals in some cases. Unless we address that issue then there will be further viruses in future. One thing also that this video didn't touch upon was just how quickly Spanish flu was forgotten, or why. It's only recently that we've started to take an interest in it.",sadness
2020,Pandemic,"Regarding the W.H.O., The issue with the W.H.O. is not relevancy but the disparity of international funding where one member contributes much more than others who have an even greater influence on its policy.

The de jure states in the form of Republics and the de jure united States were subsumed, or set aside by the Bankruptcy Act of 1933.  

All  jurisdiction over criminal proceedings are initiated by the presumption any natural born American is an “enemy of the state,” or ""resident alien enemy""  resultant to the TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACT of 1917 (aka TWEA)  as codified in Title 50 USC. Whereas, you actually come under Title 50 USC Appendix Application Sec. -§21, and as such, are not to be presumed either  “enemy of the state,” or ""resident alien enemy"" nor a repatriated US citizen. They ignore that to steal your wealth in what is called a ""taking"" which has to do with State sponsored Piracy. 

The Courts and the States through Law Enforcement Officers are enforcing the following code on American nationals:  Title 50 USC Appendix App, Trading, Act, Sec. §4, “Licenses to enemy or ally of enemy insurance or reinsurance companies; change of name; doing business in United States,” as a result of the passage of The Amendatory Act of March 9, 1933 to Title 50 USC, TWEA, Public Law No. 65-91 (40 Stat.

......Risk communication is a discipline in its own right...be it about COVID-19, dioxin or vaccination. My research about scientific experts has found that some can communicate risk well, whilst others cannot. The difference is explained by the degree of social literacy that an expert possesses. Social literacy is the ability to understand the psycho-social and socio-political context of a risk. This approach cuts across the argument about risks being socially-constructed, since as we all know, empirical risk exists. It is how it is perceived that is the sticking point... one that is now playing out so dramatically across the world as scientists endeavour to explain the reasoning behind the differences in the selection of risk levels. Is it one metre or two apart? Is it masks or no masks? Is it elimination or herd immunity? These differences can only be explained by appreciation of the difference between science and mandated science.  Mandated science is when science is used to make political/administrative decisions ...for COVID-19, about what health measures should apply in a given situation.  The socially literate expert understands the difference between science and mandated science and so they also understand why people perceive a risk phenomenon  differently to others and tailors the risk message accordingly. Providing more and better information about COVID-19 is important but it might not cut through to enough people. A deficit of information is not the only reason why some people do not 'believe the science' behind decision-making on COVID-19. An approach that is based on the mental model of risk communication is also useful . it will be very much needed in coming years when large-scale vaccinations become possible.",sadness

But I just want to shed a little light on the hundreds of thousands of factory workers who don't get to stay home because their company has found some loophole that designates them as ""essential"" and not affected by shelter in place orders. In the case of the company I work for, they use their trucks to haul medical supplies and equipment, so that makes the company essential. That means the whole operation from the ground up gets to stay in full swing.

Or would the side effects of that wipe the human population down to hardly an people left at all?

WIth all the infrastructure shut down and supply chain for food production halted people unaffected by the pandemic would starve/freeze and/or die of exposure to cold and other disease...one virus could remove mankind from position as dominant species in VERY short order ....the only survivers might be people living in remote settings with the skill set to live off the land....maybe 2% or something of people in the world?  maybe?

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"On an airplane a young mom had her hands full with an infant and a toddler AND a few vocal, intolerant and flat out rude selfish people. So I played silent peek a boo with whichever child was glancing my way as many times as I could and I offered to lend a hand should she need one. It was however the simple sentence “you are doing fine, good job, your a great mom and btw thank you” that floored her. She was stunned to hear something nice coming from a stranger which made me kinda sad and angry at the same time but I kept that to myself and just smiled at her. 

It would be a better world if we were more supportive to everyone around us as the common practice; if we could forget about judging so much and spend more time discerning if we can contribute positively in any given moment.",joy

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Who else had this show up on their feed two weeks into the covid-19 crisis?,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,It’s so easy to criticize others when you’re not going through it. How can parents accept or trust a doctor recommending vaccines after their child had a reaction? In our society we except that people can have allergic reactions to food and their environment. But when it comes to vaccines we trust the doctors without question! Vaccine reactions are  a real possibility and many parents have learned this the hard way because they trust doctors. All parents need to keep educating themselves so they can make the most informed decision.,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I think the crux of the problem is really pretty straightforward. 
It's all but impossible these days to trust the government (including the FDA), or the pharmaceutical companies, or the big corporations that have gobbled up everything.   My doctor's office used to be open 9-5:30 M-F and 8-12pm Saturdays. I could walk in and get an appointment. My doctor listened to what I said and actually tried to figure out what was wrong. She would even call my insurance if they refused to cover something that she felt I or my children needed.  Then they were bought out by Cleveland Clinic( one of the 2 MEGA hospitals here), my doctor was sent across town only to be followed by a revolving door of doctors who didn't know, didn't care, or didn't have the time to actually listen and look into any out of the norm issues. 
  What choice do we have but to try to figure it out on our own, when everything we were supposed to be able to trust has lied to us( whether by omission or otherwise). My mother-in-law still thinks Pop-Tarts are a healthy breakfast because they have ""fruit"" in them!!
  If your husband cheated on you over and over again for years and lied about it every time, no one would think you were being ridiculous if you didn't trust him anymore. In fact, they'd probably think you naive for staying with him simply because he said he wouldn't do again.
  She's making it out to be an issue of the pressures put on Mom's. And while this may be part of the problem, I'll say again that I think what really happened is that we were left to try to figure out on our own, because we can't trust what we're told from those who are supposed to have our best interest in mind.",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"My daughter is 56.  When she was 7 she developed Alopecia.  I took her to a Dermatologist.  He told me that the bald spots on her head was my fault.

I can't tell you how I felt going home, every time I had to correct her, I could envision, the fact that I was making her hair fall out.  I still blame myself all these years later.  Even though, she hasn't lived at  home since she was 18 and is a retired fire captain.  The shaming, blame,  and guilt, still hunts me to this day.",sadness

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,The human body is amazing!,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Some people may find that reading the information is easier for them. 
Influenza vaccines work by using inactivated viral particles containing hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase NA(sub-Varian particles) to trigger an immune response by injecting it into the muscle. Immune cells such as macrophages, T and B cells will break the hemagglutinin into small components by ingesting it(macrophage phagocytosis). On the surface of the macrophage, the hemagglutinin antibody and the major histocompatibility complex(MHC t-cells) will appear. Now the MHC t-cells can bind to antigens associated with the MHC. T-cells become either cytotoxic t-cells, suppressor t-cells, or helper t-cells. Helper t-cells have hemagglutinin receptors, can produce antibody creation, and help with memory b-cell activation. B-cells can ingest hemagglutinin without MHC. After ingestion, it then presents the hemagglutinin along with the MHC on its surface. If an active B expressing the antigen MHC and T-cells interact, the T-cell secretes lymphokines, which will differentiate the b-cell into either a memory b-cell or a plasma cell. Plasma cells make hemagglutinin antibodies specific to the strain in the vaccine. Memory b-cells help fight against future infections by activating the immune response.
Aerosol droplets containing live influenza droplets try to infect the nasopharyngeal epithelial layer of the body. The antibodies either block or diminish the severity of the virus.",joy

When' was the last time someone you know had carrot juice when they were in the hospital? When's the last time your doctor suggested a Breville Juicer for you to better your health?  If I ever contracted Covid-19 I know what I would do.   I'd use my Breville juicer to basically flood my body with nutrients to highly boost and maintain my immune system.  My immune system being at its' ultimate health, I'm convinced, would kick some serious Covid-19 butt.  I'd be juicing/drinking carrots, apples, spinach, beets, celery, kale, cucumber, garlic, lemon, ginger root and turmeric mixed together. I'd guzzle a glass of this medicine every three or four hours and sleep and rest as much as I could. I'd have Tropicana Low Acid OJ on hand and would eat light - such as soups for a while. I'd take aspirin w/food to reduce fever, might add vitamin D3 and would take hot, relaxing baths to reduce stress. With my immune system and vitamin levels boosted high and body and mind rested Covid-19 wouldn't last long in my opinion.  The Gerson Institute has cured patients of various stages of cancer using juicing as the main therapy.  Covid-19 is a virus.  Enough said?

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"The problem that nobody seems to be talking about with the genetically active vaccines is that it is the equivalent of a computer program for your cells, therefore any random atomic event (they happen all the time due to cosmic rays and background radiation) will change the programming in that vaccine and produce a different outcome and the nature of that is unknown. The difference with a traditional vaccine is that the older technologies (or the QLD vaccine) have many copies of an otherwise inert antigen packed up for your immune cells to react with so a mutation effect has a tiny fraction of the impact that a change to a replicated genetic code would have, because in an RNA vaccine the code is amplified by the cells in your body, in fact that is how it works, by turning your own cells into antigen factories. But what if those antigens are from a mutated genetic instruction and trigger antibodies to your own tissues, or worse are a protein that is biologically active, and toxic. Some of the most toxic substances ever discovered are natural proteins, e.g. Ricin. So where in this newer vaccine technology are the usual checksums etc. that allow for error correcting? There is no error correcting available in a single strand of RNA, which is why nature evolved double stranded DNA, the second strand is a backup to prevent mutations from being replicated (most of the time). This is why the Queensland covid-19 vaccine was really the safest option compared to the Oxford vaccine.",sadness

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,One good news is that the human adenovirus vector has been studied for quite a long time and proven safe. Can't say the same for monkey adenovirus and mRNA.,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I hope this vaccine becomes a game-changer in the field of COVID.  If it is safe and effective then it would be great for mankind and many families would be stopped from being shattered.,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Press should ask the same questions to all vaccine researchs. Have they published in prominent academic medical journals?,sadness

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"What kind of antibodies do these vaccines aim to produce? Is it the same kind of antibodies that your body makes it you actually get sick of the virus, which is IgG? If so, does IgG guarantee that you're immune to Covid-19 and you're not infectious to others? And if yes, for how long?",joy

How Do you feel ? any improvement with the long covid ?",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Many thanks to you and Prof Altman. I was hoping you would touch on why FDA refused AZ / Oxford vaccine trial resumption in USA? Its a bit worrying,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Thanks so much for that, it was enormously helpful, as are all of your videos. I'll be passing it along to others.

I'm so sorry about your pelvis, That's the last thing you need! Hope things improve very soon.

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I was like when did I subscribed to this channel and why? Scrolled the list and few videos down I realized why LoL,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,With regards the estimates for deaths at 2 minutes 30... I was under the impression that the death rate was 0.3% (from the CDC) but this comes to 0.7%. I did a bit of googling and it looks like the CDC no longer support 0.3%. I am not sure the factor 2 matters for the message in this video but I would like to understand what prompted the revision to the IFR...?,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Thank you very much! It's worth noting that the fastest vaccine to market ever in history was the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine, and that was in 1967. So in more than 50 years, we haven't managed to speed that process up (arguably because we learned that we needed to make the process safer after we learned more about immunology). A variant of that vaccine is still in use today. Hope your pelvis heals soon and thank you very much to Prof. Altman for his thoughts.",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Thank you for the work of getting these facts organized and so well presented. Mend well. Mend soon!,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I'm curious has the medical establishment asked or tracked whether people with different reactions to covid ... might flu shots even a year ago or longer might make people either less vulnerable or more  to covid.  The same question as to pneumonia vaccine.,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Great video!,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Great video, I've been wanting a straightforward piece to help me discuss with other people why getting any vaccine is not good enough and that we won't have something by the end of this year, so thank you and Prof Altmann. Sorry about your pelvis and... DB6 probably!",ambiguous

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"What about people with long covid? I'm 100% better now from that, it took 6 months, but I'm worried getting the vaccine may stimulate the immune system and overreact, causing a similar experience to long covid, and possibly leading in the worst case to ME .. I hope you get better soon.",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,You seem bright! Get on the stage with Robert Kennedy!,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,The numbers on death due to C-19 for herd immunity are still way too low.  The burden of disease is way higher than expected according to the October 2020 JAMA reports.,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Can we please be done with the Conspiracy theories. I'm a borderline Long Hauler and I have not slept more than a few hours a night since June, my hair is falling out in clumps and I have strange little bumps on my arms. We are moving more indoors in the States,   even reasonable people are feeling the stress of Covid19, and a vaccine is most welcome for the people who want to take it. Not that long ago people were contracting Polio and Smallpox. I will be one of the first lab rats to take it just to move on with life. Take care of yourself Run-DMC, you are very important to so many people and provide hope and answers to a group of people who feel that they are permanently living in the Upside Down.",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"As always, thank you for shedding clear light on this terrible, broad subject!",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"READ *** assignment for all long haulers .. spoke to 2 long haulers who said the particular beer Heineken gave them some relief ... not sure why this brand but thats what i hear , .maybe something in it  i dont know .. but if you can  lets take a poll try this and report .. thanks",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Good video, very professions but then again as you stated its your profession so that figures. however I really couldn't catch your names in the video were you presented yourself as an Oxford graduate. not that it matters really but its always nice to know. Anyhow I posted a question on a previous video on the long haulers experience of fluctuations in the possible post viral effects. I had Covid in march starting with lack of smell and mostly just feeling sick (no respiratory symptoms aside from one day coughing). I was treated in maj for another condition that I have had for a long time (chostochondritis) and got some anti-inflammatory meds and muscle relaxants. I then got side effects that I attributed to the meds, but the do linger month after quoting the meds. Tinnitus, dizziness, nausea are the most prominent ones and after physical workout I get the backlash days after. BUT its not the same all the time. Thats my question!! for periods I can work out (I used to compete amateur level powerlifting btw I'm 51 stated competing at 48). I can run and work hard physically, and then suddenly its like I get all the same issues you describe bot not as severe. So I wonder if there are others that experience this non linear effect. most forums I have looked into have mostly emotionally driven comments and lack an analytic perspective on their own suffering. But you seams to have a good source of sufferers out there that might have a bit more objective view on their own experience. any thoughts on this, can we be healthy in periods having the affected immunesystem laying passive and popping up when ever it feels like it? btw never mind spelling and poor grammar I'm not english. Best Niclas",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,P.S. Many thanks to Prof. Altmann too.😊,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"You contribute, unintentionally, to the anti-vax movement that you deplore, by ignoring at least three ways the vaccine development can be sped up without reducing - in one of the ways, actually increasing - scientific accuracy and safety.",ambiguous
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"You don't even mention human challenge testing. Very bad omission. It is the most important - and  entirely legit - way of speeding up the process. It increases the scientific control and accuracy of the trial, while eliminating arbitrary anti-scientific delays in the current process. 
Fortunately the Imperial college vaccine effort is finally considering it. 
it should have been used already for a small number of trial volunteers already in Phase 2, for all the vaccine  assays. Precious time has been lost by the failure to use this best scientific method, with millions of victims of this failure, on top of all the victims like yourself of our earlier failures failures on this virus.",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Good guy to debate Robert Kennedy jr.,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Before you decide to have the flu vaccine this year, please watch Dr. John Campbell on the same topic from two months ago.",ambiguous
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,But what about Sweden. Very low morbidity for many months. Looks like herd immunity to me. We will know for sure in a few years.,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,If this is solid science get on the same stage as Robert Kennedy. Not as dialogue but as dialectic!,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,No blasting the DMC for a while 😉,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Not sure how any vaccine is going to help C19 Long Haulers so perhaps this video has no relevance to our situation,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Seriously? Bill Gates humanitarian ad before this session. What a liar!!,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"""She was different"" worst answer ever 😂",anger

Classic Regina Phelange😂😂",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Can we take a moment to appreciate how good Aniston's acting is in here?,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Ik this is irrelevant but Rachel's outfit in this scene is litt

Edit thanks for the likeeees",ambiguous
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I really don't think the ""break"" argument really matters. He slept with someone the SAME DAY they fought. That shit would have hurt just about anybody. And he knew it was wrong, he even ran throughout the city trying to stop Rachel from finding out.",anger
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"In Season 9, Ross and Chandler's roles are reversed when Chandler's alone with his flirty co-worker in Oklahoma:
Monica: ""Is she pretty?""
Chandler: ""Ah... um.""
Ross: ""Answer faster. Answer faster.""
Chandler: ""I don't know.""
Ross: ""Answer better. Answer better.""",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Joey : awful  .. Horrible  ..nothing  comparing to you  

Chandler : she was not good..  Not good  😁😁😁",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"You know when you look back throughout their relationship you can kind of understand where Rachel is coming from. I mean Ross was very clingy and he was always jealous of every guy she talk to you even though she had no interest in them, and all she really wanted was some space, but instead of respecting that he went to sleep with another woman the same day they broke up. If you ask me that is a sign of a toxic relationship.",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,The fact that this scene is still debatable 26 years later shows how good of a show this was. I seriously miss F.R.I.E.N.D.S,sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I love Chandler’s and Joey’s reactions to what is happening outside always makes me laugh 😂,joy

We could totally pull them off even in 2020
Stylist did a great job",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,This was honestly the scene that made me truly applaud Jennifer Aniston. David Schwimmer’s non-verbal and verbal communications are always on point.,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I just realized how great the costume design was in this scene. Both Ross and Rachel start with the same color coat and then as their breakup progresses their coats come off. I don’t know if this was a conscious decision or not but it’s great.,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"From this episode comes : 
1- the biggest joke of Friends : we were on a break 
2 -the biggest discussion of the series : were Ross and Rachel on a break or he cheated her ? 
3 - Ross and Rachel will only be a ""real couple again"" in the last season and the last episode 
4 - anyone ( even the people who doesn't watch Friends ) can have a opinion about this situation , if they were or not ""on a break""

The conclusion is WHAT A AMAZING EPISODE",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Rachel--""She was in there when I was in there?""

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,We should appreciate the fact that Jennifer's acting was absolutely superb in this one!,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"It's crazy how the show coped togehter one of the most intense serious stories told (Ross and Rachel break-up) and one of the funniest (the gang stuck in the room). This episode is a great example, of why Friends is one of the best shows of all time.",joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Can we take a moment to appreciate how good Anniston's acting is in here?,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,2:24 it's kinda funny to see Rachel saying that,joy

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Ross: this can't be it.
Rachel: then how come it is?
The world momentarily stopped.",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Where Ross is Right: He technically didn’t do anything wrong since Rachel said she wanted a break from them. He broke no written rules.

Where Ross is Wrong: It is not the accepted practice. If you break up with your partner it is not fair to sleep with someone else on that same day if you ever want to get back together with your partner. It’s just an unwritten rule.",sadness
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,This whole fight was petty but ross leaving the door open at the end was peak pettiness,sadness

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Can't believe David denied casting Ross at first. He was born for being Ross. He's such a great actor,joy
2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Rachel's voice was so funny, ""Oh yeah, yeah...yeahhh, yeah, yeahh.""",joy

2020,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Propose sending money to everyone: oppose because most people don't need it. Propose to send money to unemployed: oppose because reduce incentive to look for work. Propose tax cut: agree because it will trickle down to everyone. Give me a break...,anger

I don't need a stimulus check but my daughter had to quit her second job and she needs more money.  If she got a bigger stimulus I wouldn't have to give her as much as I do. And I could save more for retirement which I will need unless I get covid-19 and die than none of it will matter to me. Course we all no Mitch ain't gonna give us that much .,sadness

7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

Thanks to months of physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy, as well as special infant formula and baby bottles she began to thrive once again. She is now a healthy young woman with a 2 year old daughter of her own. She also served in the U.S. Air Force.

2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,"I don’t care what your data says. My child was a beautiful, happy, mild-mannered baby girl who was progressing beyond her peers. Within 1 hour of the MMR vaccine, she was screaming uncontrollably. Nothing seemed to soothe her. She was unable to obtain eye contact and quickly lost the ability to verbalize within a day. My daughter turned 26 last week. She was diagnosed with severe autism at the age of 3. After loads  of therapy and visits to numerous physicians, she functions anywhere between a 2 to an 8 year old.

2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,One of my issues with vaccines is the stuff that is going into them. Also I feel the studies arent reliable or trustworthy enough.

This is a study that would be most helpful. This is a study that needs to be done.,joy

2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Everyone’s bodies work differently. Just like some medications work well for some it may not for others. Vaccines are the same way. I was forced into giving my last child a vaccine because I had concerns resulting from how my first child reacted. My first child went unconscious immediately and her pediatrician was unable to wake her. She knew the vaccine caused it. My second child’s leg swelled ten times the normal size and she started having seizures, high fever, paralysis, and uncontrollable screaming for four days straight. Her pediatrician claimed that it was a normal reaction. She’d never had any health issues before that day now she does. Her pediatrician finally admitted that the vaccines caused it but that she couldn’t report it or she would loose her job. She was the one who forced me to let them harm my kid. And now she says my kid will have issues for the rest of her life. It would be different if doctors were educated enough to treat people as individuals and not in the box treatments, it would be different if people had a choice and was not forced into treatments that could possibly harm them, and it would be amazing if people could sue vaccine companies when they were injured by their vaccines. But unfortunately none of those things were possible for us.",sadness

Along those lines, I got my HPV vaccine in my teenage years and my mom just sat there excitedly going “isn’t it cool?! We have a vaccine that can help prevent cancer!!!!!” Really never thought more of it past that tbh. I love my mom

I was furious. I wanted to scream and yell, and I was angry that my husband was so blase about it... When I asked him why he didn't yell at her or get angry, he said, ""It wouldn't help, and we're in charge of the boys."" It was so direct and true that it immediately calmed me and I even laughed a bit.

2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Concerning the pain issue: I was part of the first girls to be vaccinated in my country. Everyone complained about the pain, but it's not that bad. 
Yes, it hurts a bit when getting it (same as other vaccines) but what bothered me was the bit of swelling and the constant feeling of pressure on the shot site. I think it's a located edema sort of thing. It was the only vaccine I used ice on my arm though, and the nurses even recommended it, because they already knew that was a complaint most girls had. Think of it as a minor muscular injury, or as getting hit in a fight with your siblings. It's that kind of soreness, not really acute pain. It went away after a couple of days, but it did make me not want to move my arm for the first 24h. It was just sore.
My friends and most of the girls in my school getting vaccinated described the same feeling. That being said, pain is subjective. You may be able to take it in stride or feel that soreness for a little longer.",sadness

2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,"I had initial reservations for my oldest getting the vaccine due to some bad information I got in it's early release phase. I definitely should've taken a bit more of a critical eye to the doubt placed in my head about it, being someone who studied biology, microbiology and human genetics in school. I wasn't stupid about vaccines, how they're developed, how they function and how they help. But I went back and researched into some peer-reviewed studies and reports and felt far more at ease that the initial information I got was more of a misinterpretation of reality and didn't report things in a scientific, or educational, manner. It was a bit of sensationalism and I didn't take the proper care when digesting the information. She has her vaccine series now (15 as of yesterday).

A couple of years ago, I got to assess a patient that experienced severe lip swelling 6 months after getting lip HA filler!? It turned out she was experiencing a severe viral infection (Influenza). A Medrol dose pack helped resolved the swelling and there was no need to use hyaluronidase! Patient healed from viral infection, lip swelling resolved quickly, and patient was happy, she got to keep her lips looking good!👍🏽😉💋",sadness

2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Thank you so much Dr Rajani, this has really helped relieve any anxiety. I suffer autoimmune diseases and I'm immunocompromised because of my medications. I have dermal fillers, done this year. Cheek, chin, lips. And I have to have the vaccine very soon. I have an inflammatory disorder, however I've never suffered with exaggerated swelling from HA dermal fillers and even aqualyx was very successful.  With your information, I feel at ease that even if I get swelling, it will only be temporary and resolved with antihistamines. Again, thank you so much for touching on this and on people like myself who suffer with autoimmune disease.",sadness

I was going to get my Radiesse when I get home??? Should I not get that now?

Also I only know about Sculptra in regards to my auto immune diseases. But I didn’t know that auto immune diseases can I have an affect on “other” fillers. Do you have a video for that? 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",sadness
2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,Thank you for this video!,joy
2020,Vaccines and Side Effects,"From my reading, one person’s reaction resolved with antihistamines, 2 people got a short oral steroid taper and it resolved.  My take on this is if you’re going to get the vaccine, maybe hold off for a while before getting fillers (I don’t think anyone knows exactly how long to wait).  If you’ve gotten fillers, risk is low, but possible, that you get swelling.  But if you are aware why it’s happening and get treated, it resolves and is not a big deal.  Better than getting sick w COVID!",sadness

After Jesus rose from the dead, this is what he said.
Luke 24:
46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

48 And ye are witnesses of these things.

49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

----------------------------------------------------------
Then we see the gift of the Holy Ghost poured out, which is the promise of the Father Jesus said to wait for in Jerusalem.
Acts 2
King James Version
2 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.

2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.

4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
----------------------------------------------

And then Peter preaches the gospel to them,  and repentance and remission of sins preached in His name.
Acts 2:
36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.

41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.

Repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
That is how you are saved from your sins.

Just as Jesus commanded. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matthew 28  :18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

They baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Jesus Christ.
One name given among men whereby we must be saved.
This is why every baptism done was in Jesus name, Jesus did not say to dunk them in water repeating the phrase ""Father Son and Holy Ghost"", he said to baptize them in the -NAME- of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
They did as Jesus commanded.
------------------------------------

Mark 16:
15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.



And you see the Samaritans receiving the Word of God, and being baptized in Jesus name and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost in acts 8
Acts 8:
12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.

14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:

15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:

16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
------------------------------------------------------------

And the Gentiles, receiving the same gospel, and the same obedience following. 
Acts 10:
43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.

45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.

46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,

47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

They believed, and even received the gift of the Holy Spirit, they knew they received it, because they spake with tongues and magnified God, the same thing that happened to them, [Acts 2]
And the first thing that was done, is that they were commanded to be baptized in the name of Jesus.

Because that is how you get your sins washed away.
Just as Ananias told Paul.....

Acts 22:
12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,

13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.

14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.

15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.

16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.



That is why Paul was baptized, and this is his own account...
Which goes with the rest of the scripture.
1 Peter 3:
18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.

21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:

22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.



And now why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

Romans 6
King James Version
6 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?

2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?

4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.",joy

I'm not sure such a broad qualitative fact of an Australian outbreak really speaks against the obvious null hypothesis that loosening of restrictions has increased transmission in various places irrespective of the season. Some seasonality would certainly be expected but are we really seeing it in the data already?

When they run out of leave they are out of money. They have to pay their health care costs if they get suck too as their insurance doesn't cover enough. Once they are sick they may not even be able to teach your child online. The smart thing would be to start the year online.

Q. What can we do to help?
A. Thank you for asking that question. I appreciate your concern. I have 3 sons on the autism spectrum. Mostly, our families can be unintentionally forgotten. 
1. If you know a family caring for a person with disabilities; call them, video chat, check in by offering to drop off things that they need if you're near by and if you are able. 
2. Remind the family, and especially the person with disabilities that they are special and important. 
3. Don't patronize. Listen. Make us laugh. We like that. Talk. Bring up things that are not disability related. 
4. We live in that world not by choice. Feel free to talk about something else of interest. We like that. 
5. Just, treat us normal; we are, yet, we aren't.

May God bless you and your family and keep you safe and healthy during these trying times.

You want to write a book in your free time to ""enrich"" people's libraries? Have at it the same way. Want to study science and further its reach?Just do it on your free time. and so forth...).

2021,COVID-19,"First of all i wanna say thank you for making this nice explanation! 
But from my point of view I agree with some experts argue that preventing any infection at all is not always the point of vaccine, the goal of vaccine program for Covid-19 is not necessarily to get to 'Covid Zero' but to remove its ability to cause serious disease, hospitalization and death. It is not the problem if the type of vaccine that we receive if different, the real purpose is to give our body enough protection.",joy

Having said that, isn't the efficacy of Pfizer still quite higher than J&J even against variants? Like 70%-90% in tests. (which is no reason to not take it, just pointing that out)",sadness
2021,COVID-19,"Same story, politicians pretending to have all the answers without consulting with the experts.",ambiguous
2021,COVID-19,"Then J&J needs to do an efficacy trial at a similar time period in which the other companies did theirs. The timing COULD be why their efficacy is lower, but that isn't how science works - that doesn't mean they'd otherwise have a higher number. Correlation does not equal causation.",sadness

This all started to surge after we started rolling out the vaccine.  Don't get me wrong, the vaccine is a life saver for the elderly and the very unhealthy, but we really need more reliable data collection for strokes and heart attacks within a year following the vaccine.

They make it exceedingly difficult to do so, require a ton of information, and then come back to you saying you have ""missing info.""  Not to mention mine was not a life-threatening case, so how many people were in the same boat that didn't feel the need to report it?  Plus I had trouble reaching my doctor to let her know. The numbers are certainly not accurate.  I stand by my decision to get the vaccine and knew the potential for side effects and I respect others' personal decisions.  I do believe the vaccine is important, but I also believe that people are not taking these side effects seriously.  How ""rare"" are they really?  Call them rare, but when you're in the same boat, it's terrifying.  I had remained healthy with masks and social distancing all throughout the pandemic, then feel ill after my vaccination.

2021,COVID-19,"Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. In addition, because no product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient has been approved outside the context of authorization for emergency use, the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain. The number and design of the clinical trials and preclinical studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established, may be different from those required for gene therapy products, or may require safety testing like gene therapy products. Moreover, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one pharmaceutical product to the next, and may be difficult to predict.",sadness

I can't seem to get the energy to work out because my heart and lungs just don't function like normal. It is so depressing my mental health is suffering as well. A terrible reality, but I see that many others have it much worse. I also see that many others who have received the vaccine have experienced exacerbated illness.

I have cleaned up my diet substantially, started breathing exercises, taken up more reading, and made many lifestyle changes. In my research I have found that is important for individuals like myself to KEEP MOVING and KEEP UP COGNITION. Do not succumb to the exhaustion. Keep doing what you can, and aim for small improvements while always listening to and respecting your body. Much love and wellness to us all.",sadness

I kept at it thinking that it might be due to deconditioning after a year of limited exercise and much of that time being very sedentary due to weakness and breathing issues.

Our entire household got COVID at the end of 2020.  My wife ended up in the hospital for 5 days.  She went through months of different therapies as it affected her memory, speech and coordination.  One would think that she had suffered a stroke.

One of the biggest problems around the world is that countries release COVID numbers as number of cases, recoveries and deaths.  The public sees all the recovered numbers and believe that it's not that bad.  All those recovered numbers indicate is recovered from infection.  Not recovered from the ""Effects"" of the infection.  

If people knew the likelyhood of suffering debilitating effects from COVID, perhaps they would take it more seriously.",sadness
2021,COVID-19,"I had something nasty in 2019, first doctor said it was strep, antibiotics made me worse, the next doctor said it's mono, it went on for months. Had to quit my job while I recovered because company wouldn't let me work from home or take sick days. Health went up and down - I tried again, I told my symptoms (long list) to a doctor and she took a look at my throat and she said ""you got thrush from the antibiotics!"" (candidiasis) she prescribed me antifungal treatment and I felt 110% better, it was an amazing difference. If you took antibiotics as part of your treatment (it's sometimes to prevent bacterial pneumonia), weak immune system + antibiotics can make you extra susceptible to fungal overgrowth. This is just anecdotal, I don't want to give medical advice, but it's something worth asking your doctor about.",sadness

Nevertheless, even a decline of 2/3 still means that 1 billion passenger-flights happened last year.   [2] Closures of borders are temporary (like an emergency or a natural disaster).  [3] Every country depends on travel, on trade, and/or some level of tourism for its economy to function and to prosper.

  its showing an accurate and deep understanding; great perceptive. 💡

Muito obrigado for all the insightful information.. 🤝",joy
2021,COVID-19,"I thought this was a disappointing video.  Yes, digital nomads are a growing phenomenon, but as they settle for a number of months in the same place, their impact on the travel industry is limited. Many of the vlogs I've seen suggest that they are often living on pretty tight budgets, so their contribution to the economy of the country they stay in is minimal (especially if they're not paying local income tax on their earnings).
There are countries such as Thailand with 20% of GDP coming from pre-covid tourism. How are these countries coping? What is the prospect that they will be able to attract tourists back while protecting their populations from imported virus outbreaks?  
Countries will be looking to get the high spenders back in as quickly as possible, after business people who invest in their economies.  High net worth individuals (from anywhere in the world, not exclusively the West) will be the ones that countries target first; backpackers who spend a few dollars a day will be way down on the priority list.
Mass tourism will return, but governments will have to consider the health risks compared to the economic gains.
This also touches on my final point.  Countries want tourists to come and spend money.  It helps the economies and can assist the balance of payments. The suggestion that tourism should do more to help local communities is misplaced.  It is up to the governments (local and national) to ensure that the money tourism brings in is channelled to local projects. It also ignores the tourist industry corporate social responsibility schemes that do work with charities and NGOs.  
I could go on, but I'll just repeat that I thought this was a poor and superficial video, not up to the usual Economist standard.",joy

2021,COVID-19 News,"Daniel’s Prayer for the People

1. Darius the Mede, who was the son of Xerxes, ruled over the kingdom of Babylonia.

2. In the first year of his reign I was studying the sacred books and thinking about the seventy years that Jerusalem would be in ruins, according to what the LORD had told the prophet Jeremiah.

3. And I prayed earnestly to the Lord God, pleading with him, fasting, wearing sackcloth, and sitting in ashes.

4. I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed the sins of my people. I said, *Lord God, you are great, and we honor you. You are faithful to your covenant and show constant love to those who love you and do what you command.

5. *We have sinned, we have been evil, we have done wrong. We have rejected what you commanded us to do and have turned away from what you showed us was right.

6. We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our rulers, our ancestors, and our whole nation.

7. You, Lord, always do what is right, but we have always brought disgrace on ourselves. This is true of all of us who live in Judea and in Jerusalem and of all the Israelites whom you scattered in countries near and far because they were unfaithful to you.

8. Our kings, our rulers, and our ancestors have acted shamefully and sinned against you, Lord.

9. You are merciful and forgiving, although we have rebelled against you.

10. We did not listen to you, O LORD our God, when you told us to live according to the laws which you gave us through your servants the prophets.

11. All Israel broke your laws and refused to listen to what you said. We sinned against you, and so you brought on us the curses that are written in the Law of Moses, your servant.

12. You did what you said you would do to us and our rulers. You punished Jerusalem more severely than any other city on earth,

13. giving us all the punishment described in the Law of Moses. But even now, O LORD our God, we have not tried to please you by turning from our sins or by following your truth.

14. You, O LORD our God, were prepared to punish us, and you did, because you always do what is right, and we did not listen to you.

15. *O Lord our God, you showed your power by bringing your people out of Egypt, and your power is still remembered. We have sinned; we have done wrong.

16. You have defended us in the past, so do not be angry with Jerusalem any longer. It is your city, your sacred hill. All the people in the neighboring countries look down on Jerusalem and on your people because of our sins and the evil our ancestors did.

17. O God, hear my prayer and pleading. Restore your Temple, which has been destroyed; restore it so that everyone will know that you are God.

18. Listen to us, O God; look at us and see the trouble we are in and the suffering of the city that bears your name. We are praying to you because you are merciful, not because we have done right.

19. Lord, hear us. Lord, forgive us. Lord, listen to us, and act! In order that everyone will know that you are God, do not delay! This city and these people are yours.*

The Seventy-Weeks Prophecy

20. I went on praying, confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel and pleading with the LORD my God to restore his holy Temple.

21. While I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came flying down to where I was. It was the time for the evening sacrifice to be offered.

22. He explained, *Daniel, I have come here to help you understand the prophecy.

23. When you began to plead with God, he answered you. He loves you, and so I have come to tell you the answer. Now pay attention while I explain the vision.

24. *Seven times seventy years is the length of time God has set for freeing your people and your holy city from sin and evil. Sin will be forgiven and eternal justice established, so that the vision and the prophecy will come true, and the holy Temple will be rededicated.

25. Note this and understand it: From the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until God's chosen leader comes, seven times seven years will pass. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defenses, and will stand for seven times sixty-two years, but this will be a time of troubles.

26. And at the end of that time God's chosen leader will be killed unjustly. The city and the Temple will be destroyed by the invading army of a powerful ruler. The end will come like a flood, bringing the war and destruction which God has prepared.

27. That ruler will have a firm agreement with many people for seven years, and when half this time is past, he will put an end to sacrifices and offerings. The Awful Horror will be placed on the highest point of the Temple and will remain there until the one who put it there meets the end which God has prepared for him.*",joy

But now having seen how the home-based worker has kept the country going we are now seen as essential to a company's productivity and the disabled are no longer seen as a burden to the employer.

Next month I'm starting at a new job that allows for flexible working. I can divide up my time between home and the office. I think a lot of businesses will need to adapt to this or they'll start seeing much higher turnover.

We know that working from home is possible in a lot of jobs where we were previously told it wasn't. People aren't going to forget that information and are going to fight for that right.",joy

2021,COVID-19 News,"I used to work from home before the pandemic hit, but only for 1-2 days maximum per week.

It was less stressful working from home, I didn't need to worry about travelling into the office, sitting in a hot and poorly ventilated environment that could be quite noisy - I was able to feel more comfortable and thus more productive. On the flip side, I put on a lot of weight and found that I was losing my ability to socialise with people like I could before. I now almost feel trapped at home; be more comfortable at home and less socially active/able vs be far less comfortable in the office but be able to socialise again and lose some weight. It's really tough, for me personally, but in general I just hope that the majority of employers enable people to make a conscious choice about where they work and improve their office infrastructure for those who wish to work in a physical office.",sadness

2021,COVID-19 News,"it's not as simple as people suggest because it depends on the actual business, the skillset, the requirements, and so much more.
Regular customer-facing jobs require you to be at work - a lot of jobs are customer facing and unfortunately for some disabled people they also have health risks which meant whilst others were able to go to work some werent able to... not only has covid put a lot of strain on these businesses but it has also meant trying to find ways to keep disabled people in work who already had a lot of adjustments made to make it possible before the pandemic.

As for homeworking - certain businesses needed to make sure the servers could manage and the security was in place... this was a priority and something that had to be done quickly but also meet requirements - so again this meant certain individuals struggled because their needs were not met ... but it affected a lot of people. Not just disabled people.
I know at my workplace we had a blind person who required a special set up for the computer to be able to communicate in one ear where his curser was and the customer would be in the other ear - he was also scheduled to be on shift with the same person who also assisted him with other stuff such as when breaks were, limitations of the system, complex customer requests etc --- the equipment could never be turned off and required a certain connection speed etc.
So when we went to homeworking, not only was it an extremely hard task to get the equipment working at home due to space required, internet speed, and lockdown restrictions - he also did not have an assistant to do all the other tasks.

As for working at home in general -- the hardest thing is trust -- being able to trust that workers are doing their job correctly and efficiently... whilst some thrive working at home, others have taken advantage of the situation -- again at my workplace, it has been noted the increase in ""system down"" times where workers are saying their system is down yet dont realise because it's connected to a server for remote access it is possible to have more than one person logged on to see what problems exist.

I completely agree that IF it is possible to work from home AND it is beneficial to the company, then working from home should be an option. But at the end of the day, it is down to the company. It may be easier to work from home (whether that be a disability, childcare, comfort, anxiety etc), but from a company point of view it means they can easily have meanings, discussions, offer assistance, keep better track of issues or employees without the concern of having to deal with technology where people's internet goes down, the camera isnt working, the system is doing an update, theyve lost the charger, etc
Essentially, if you can be in work and they can make the necessary adjustments at work, then you should go to work.

I wonder how happy people would be if their work said you'd need to take a pay cut for working from home.

As harsh as it may seem... sometimes in life, regardless of the person, we have to realise our own limitations -- none of the people in this video 'need' to work from home.

of course there are plenty of benefits to work from home... but there's also plenty of benefits working at a workplace - the main one being the social interaction with others -- arguably since the first lockdown more people have been struggling with mental health issues because of working from home due to families not understanding, they are working or having to deal with tech issues themselves, being able to switch off from work and separate work from home etc.

Maybe the solution is mix working... have so many days in the office for when they need meetings etc and then the rest of the time at home (if it benefits the company).
There's only so much responsibility you can put on the company...at the end of the day it is a business and they haven't forced you to work for them. 

You also get those who want to work from home but also want the company to pay for their electricity and heating.

Working at home is not essential in order to get the work done. It can work for some, but not for all, and it's a lot more work to manage with some at home and some in the office -- so just have them all in the office.

Why apply for a job that you can't do?
Why apply for a job when you don't want to work there?
Why expect special equipment, and changes, etc and then once you get all that demand even more so you can comfortably work at home and everyone else goes back into the office and then everyone has to make further adjustments because you want to work from home.",sadness

I cannot tolerate going to virtual classes.
So after  so eventually I started cutting classes 
 Constantly leaving Zoom meetings 
And going on other websites on my school laptop that had nothing to do with school 
I even cheated on some math and exams I had just so I could get As and not Fs
Every time there was a question on the test I googled it instead of using my head.
In p e  my teacher assigned cardio assignments.
When my caregivers were watching me I would look at the computer screen
And pretend that I was doing the cardio 
But when they were not looking I just stood there north doing anything at all
You know how every zoom meeting has a chat page
Well the chat really distracted.me from class
Instead of participating in class and paying attention I would turn off my camera and mute my microphone 
And  sometimes  depending on my mood and energy level
If the teacher assigned work I would only do half the worksheet using google slides and then turn it in.
So you see?
Virtual school makes me very very lazy
Because there's always something I don't feel like doing.",sadness

SUMMARY SARS-CoV-2 can mutate and evade immunity, with consequences for efficacy of emerging vaccines and antibody therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding motif (RBM) is a highly variable region of S and provide epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characterization of a prevalent, sentinel RBM mutation, N439K. We demonstrate N439K S protein has enhanced binding affinity to the hACE2 receptor, and N439K viruses have similar in vitro replication fitness and cause infections with similar clinical outcomes as compared to wild type. We show the N439K mutation confers resistance against several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, including one authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and reduces the activity of some polyclonal sera from persons recovered from infection. Immune evasion mutations that maintain virulence and fitness such as N439K can emerge within SARS-CoV-2 S, highlighting the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to guide development and usage of vaccines and therapeutics.",joy

2021,COVID-19 News,"'84

It reminds me of a summer's day
Of '84 and far beyond,
That 'tripletrup' of children's play,
That joyful rattling in the sun. 

Today I hear no children sing, 
Nor laugh nor run in happy mood. 
What happened that the world so fast Turned dark those brightly colored boots? 

My eye now wanders to the frame,
Your happy smile makes me so sad.
They said one couldn't do a thing,
This virus is ev'ryman's dread. 

'Ur unborn child I'd loved to know,
Yet nothing can be done 'gainst fate, 
So we were by doctors told,
If the vaccine came too late. 

I feel the darkness closing in,
Much stronger than most people do, 
A darkness spreading through all towns
Not stopping even before truth.

My door is shut, the sun goes down, 
The puppets' triptrups echoe loud.
This steady sound, it makes me fear,
The worst to come seems not yet here.

I look at what my hands still hold, 
An orange pill that makes me sleep,
That tells me that it's all okay 
And makes me dream of white fat sheep. 

The clock goes tiktok and I sleep,
Tiktok - Tiktok, I am gone so deep.
Will I ever wake up 'gain,
To see what happened to us men?

Break them into groups then congregate them and mate them
Let them reproduce and then make offspring and raise them
Oblivious to who truly teaches and educates them, we’ll
Take from the masses and place them in classes
And rate them all based on each’s economical status
Some we will exalt to the highest while the others we’ll let fall
Then we’ll slowly analyze how one’s privilege affects all
We’ll construct a dual system for the poor one and the rich one
And study how they blend and acclimate to their conditions
We’ll divide them into sections and keep sharing this approach
And let the wealth and poverty then measure the characters of both
Provide physical temptation that treats, lures and entices
Create dependencies on our electronic devices
Program and make the man’s fragile psyche indecisive
And watch the nicest ones become savages in a crisis
See each step of this game, for years kept it the same
Present to them a goal in life that they’ll never obtain
Within the range of our power each child will be born
Then, place chemicals in them to see how their bodies respond
We’ll keep the poor that way by denying them a favor
And see how long they take to resort to violent behavior
We’ll subject their generations to uncompensated labor
Enslave them all and make them still love their enslaver
We’ll endanger them and afterwards they’ll call on us to save ‘em
Trust our doctors to cure the sicknesses that we gave ‘em
Make ‘em spend all their days trapped in a unfair maze
Purposely prepare slaves through radio airwaves
Formulate drugs, and then, distribute them through every state
And make conditions that cause them to use them to escape
What if we make ‘em run to evil and see good with reluctance
Make ‘em prioritize the superficial over the substance
Let’s form a secret government to do the really shady acts
Deny people basic human rights to see how they react
Let’s promise them riches if they put their souls on the block
We’ll control all that they listen to and all that they watch
Tamper with frequencies, let’s clone the animals and the food
Give the people faulty medicines just to alter their moods
We can play with human hormones, let’s see where this goes
Wonder what happens when we let women and men switch roles?
Or better yet, switch our bodies, no one’s heard of these things
Gender-bending pharmaceuticals and surgical means
Look at ‘em, greedy and arrogant, relying on phones
Going through life, thinking that they have a mind of their own
We can build weapons for every nation, even the streets
We’ll cause disagreements ’til nobody’s sleeping in peace",joy

the drug and the transformation of their practice from that of a place of death
to one where many patients can recover at home. One take-away I've heard from
most is how fast 24-48 hrs. patients with low oxygen saturation's in the
low-mid 80s are restored to normal levels, and can breath again. The doctors
delight at seeing this restorative effect is written across their face, as a

When someone slanders you, remember Ai’sha (RA) who was slandered throughout the city.

When you’re lonely, recall Aadam (AS) who was created alone.

When you can’t see any logic around you, think of Nuh (AS) who built an ark without questioning.

2021,COVID-19 News,"In examining the data provided by a television broadcast of some time ago conducted by the journalist Formigli, on ""La 7"", I saw something in a graph that contrasts with the official narrative provided by public institutions and the press throughout the world on handling the Covid-19 epidemic.

In the graph, many countries were compared in terms of deaths from Covid for million inhabitants, including two neighboring countries, namely Brazil and Argentina. As you know, Bolsonaro, president of Brazil, was harshly criticized for refusing to subject the population to lockdowns and other restrictive measures to fight the virus, contrary to what did instead Fernandez, President of Argentina, who, in addition to an eight-month lockdown, has imposed restrictions and impositions of all kinds on the population, with serious consequences for the economy of that country. The comparison that emerges from the graph is therefore surprising:

1) Brazil - Covid deaths per million inhabitants = 786
2) Argentina - Covid deaths per million inhabitants = 801

First of all, I note that the data contrasts with what was disseminated by the media around the world, namely the thousands of deaths that were attributed to Bolsonaro for not having adopted the anticovid measures advocated by the more ""advanced"" countries against the virus, which instead in the graph, they appear even lower than those of a neighboring country like Argentina, which had instead adopted all the restrictive anticovid measures. So, according to this graph,  published by a television channel notoriously favorable to anticovid measures, restrictions and lockdowns are not useful tools to prevent the spread of the disease and save people's lives.

Doubt arises that the question concerns exclusively the serious insufficiency of the health systems in dealing with this epidemic, and that all the restrictive measures imposed on populations all over the world have served and will only serve to destroy the social and economic fabric of the various countries.",sadness

For example, I've just watched Atkins on BBC News website pathetically try to explain away the reasons behind the HGV driver crisis here in the UK.

Atkins fails to explain the main reason behind it: PAY! (or rather the lack of it!).

There are tens and tens of thousands of licensed HGV drivers in the UK who are able to drive a HGV tomorrow. Yet they chose not to because of lack of pay, lack of amenities (toilet/showers) and a whole raft of logistical and financial barriers beyond BREXIT and Covid ( which compound the issue)..

One ‘side effect’ I didn’t hear anyone else mention—and again, same as after a big endurance event—I became a pooping machine.  Even before lunch, I would do number two at least four times.  That’s metabolism, the body burning up calories and dumping the junk from that process.

If my tests will be negative (but I know they aren't always accurate and dont pickup the infection all the time), what are the risks of me getting the Moderna vaccine if I have a Covid infection (possibly undiagnosed)? Is quite difficult in my area to get a covid vaccine, so I wouldn't postpone it unless it posts a serious risk?",sadness
2021,COVID-19 Vaccines,"Doctor Mike, I am sure that you won't get to read this. But, for whomever may read this. I literally saved someone's life today. As soon as the person stopped breathing and their pulse was undetectable. I heard Doctor Mike in my head saying, ""chest compressions, chest compressions, chest compressions."" So, to the beat of the song, ""staying alive"", I did chest compressions. When the 911 operator reminded me, I gave 2 breaths. I was panicked. Although, those around me had no idea. I just counted out sets of 10 compressions. Then the 911 operator would remind me to give 2 breaths. The first few breaths, I could hear fluid moving in his lungs. I was able to get him breathing on his own. With the 3rd or 4th breath, I literally could feel like his lungs were clearing.
I want to thank Doctor Mike, for being so repetitive about chest compressions. His guidance helped me to save a life today. 
On a side note, 33 years ago, I gave birth to my second son. So, I guess Jan 15th, is a good day for me to give life.",fear

From what I’ve read as far as the rna vaccines go, while the disease it’s fighting is new, the technology of an rna vaccine has been in development for 20 years or so. I think the science behind them is sound, yet I also agree that of course I wish there was the time to properly study any potential long term side effects.

To this day I still get hella nervous when I see needles but I don’t run thankfully lol…

For those parents who have kids that act like me during and after shots (when I was a kid), it helps a lot if you promise ice cream, offer to hold their hand and speak to them calmly, tell them you’ll take them out to a fun location afterwards, you’ll make their favorite food, etc. anything they like.

2021,Pandemic,"I worked in an office building that overlooked the first central pop-up testing facility in our city at the start of March 2020. Each day that week I saw more and more cars lined up and was prepping to ask my boss when I could switch to working flexible hours from home. Monday the 16th the entire office campus was sent home with their office supplies and told that we would reevaluate in 6 weeks. How naive was that?

I'm still working from a makeshift desk in my apartment Smith no expected return date in sight. I've lost three friends/relatives to covid-19, and had a close brush with the disease myself when someone inside my social bubble tested positive. 

This year has changed everything, from my perspective on my government, to how I evaluate what is essential or priority in life. It's been both a both liberating and lonely existence as I have resumed old hobbies, but can't see my friends or neighbors, and every time I've let my guard down, there's been some horrific reminder that the virus is still circulating, and that we can't be so cavalier just yet. 

Anyone who denies the seriousness and complexity of battling a pandemic is just as clueless and callous as those Holocaust deniers. There was a chance for us to unite for something bigger than our own self interests, and instead, we blew it, and retreated to our corners of the internet where our fears and fantasies were made real. Let the sound of a patient's lungs having the mucus sucked out of them be heard by everyone who questions the deadliness of this virus. May the smell of those dead bodies stacked in refrigerated trucks fill your nostrils. May every person with a compromised immunity weigh on your conscience when you refuse to get vaccinated to ensure their safety and your own survival.",sadness

2021,Pandemic,Thank you Frontline. This documentary should be required viewing for every student in the world when they study this pandemic.

2021,Pandemic,"“No one’s gonna help you. You’re on your own” is a great way to sum up the side effects of America’s toxic over-individualism. “Pull yourself up by your boot straps” was a saying that originally referred to an impossible task but it’s now used to embody to the (so-called) American spirit of self-reliance. We are so lost. “It takes a village” means nothing here. There is, of course, value in the idea of paving a way for yourself, but the systems we’ve built have allowed for so many of us to fall through the cracks and it’s solely on the individual to find a way out, no matter how deep that crack is. And no matter how little role any of us played in getting to that point of desperation. We demand nothing of our government when it comes to improving the material conditions of our lives. The continued Red Scare mentality has become so irrational that it’a led far too many of us to actively insist that our government remain negligent in ways that are completely foreign to the rest of the industrialized world. And COVID has made these consequential short-fallings painfully obvious. But we are far too distracted by polarization and over-politicization to even respond appropriately on a mass scale to issues that impact us all. We’ve been taught that it’s a good thing that our government is useless and, as a side effect, those at the top get to keep their pretty penny while the common, hard working man suffers.",sadness

We’ve already lost nurses, some very young, through suicide, because the emotional toll was just too great, & no one outside of those hospital walls truly understands what they’ve been through over the past year.
I just hope the government is willing to provide that support, since the mental health services are one of the most underfunded out of the entire NHS.
Thank you to everyone who has played their part, including the thousands of volunteers picking up prescriptions, shopping, driving the vulnerable to appointments & back, & just phoning them for a chat to keep them company.
As a community, I feel like we all pulled together when it was most important.

15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Romans 10:9-13 KJV 🙌🏾
9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.",joy

2021,Pandemic,"Whom Can We Trust If No One Is Trustworthy?
One of my favorite quips from Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is when Tom is defined as “a glittering hero…the pet of the old, the envy of the young,” and there were “some that believed that he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.” With these few words, Twain captured the essence of leadership in our world. Those who get to the top are the fiercest, most determined, and most ruthless. Today, the latter quality has become so intense that we can no longer believe our leaders, and certainly not trust them to have our best interest in mind.
I am not accusing any leader in particular, or even leaders as a whole. It is simply that in an egoistic world, where people vie to topple one another on their way to the top, the one at the top is clearly the one who trampled over and knocked down more people than anyone else. Concisely, to get to the top in an egoistic world you have to be the biggest egoist.
So how do we know whom to trust? We don’t know and we cannot know. All we know is that we are in the dark.
In a culture of unhinged selfishness, any conspiracy theory seems reasonable, while truth is nowhere to be found. When every person who says or writes something is trying to promote some hidden agenda, you have no way of knowing who is right, what really happened, or if anything happened at all.
The only way to get some clarity in the news and goodwill from our leaders is to say “Enough!” to our current system and build something entirely independent. The guiding principle of such a system should be “information only,” no commentary. Commentary means that information has already been skewed. Information means saying only what happened, as much as possible, not why, and not who is to blame and who we should praise.
Concurrently, we must begin a comprehensive process of self-teaching. We have to know not only what is happening, but why we skew and distort everything. In other words, we have to know about human nature and how it inherently presents matters according to its own subjective view, which caters to one’s own interest. To “clear” ourselves from that deformity, we must learn how to rise above our personal interest and develop an equally favorable attitude toward others. This is our only guarantee that our interpretation of things will be even and correct.
Once we achieve such an attitude, we will discover that the bad things we see in our world reflect our own, internal wickedness. Our ill-will toward others creates a world where ill-will governs, and so the world is filled with wickedness and cruelty. Therefore, all we need in order to create positive leadership—and to generally eliminate ill-will from the world—is to generate goodwill within us. When we nurture goodwill toward others, we will fill the world with goodwill. As a result, the world will fill with kindness and compassion. By changing ourselves, we will create a world that is opposite from the world we have created through our desires to govern, patronize, and often destroy other people.",joy

Because of that final set of instructions, some host bodies can survive from one pandemic to another in many different invisible ways. Understanding that final generic instructional set is always the key of really good life. But,  unfortunately, that last understanding is exceptionally or extremly close to zero probability. The reason is by the way the host body hardcoding its own life style and destination, even many ones try alternate or do therapy to change it. Blame that unchange stubborn on either god for good or evil for bad. One's choice is pre-set in the billions and billions of realities. That's the way the universe is!",sadness

For countries with increasing obesity and correlated CoVid19 infection rates with these individuals, is it possible that their diet resulting in obesity is adversely affecting each individual's microbiome that ultimately leads to a weakened immune system? The obesity itself may not be the cause of susceptibility to disease but just a symptom of a more elusive issue that the food industry and consumer habits are involved with. My takeaway is that natural foods prepared at home with a variety is the best way to approach diet and health in general for overall health. Thanks for the information in this segment.

I’ve always needed more sleep — 8.5 hrs has been typical for me most of my life, and about 7 hours is a minimum — and vastly prefer a late-shifted schedule. The “psychic noise” is so much less at night! I can force myself awake early when I have to travel, for instance, but anything requiring me to be awake before 7am on a regular basis is just not sustainable long term. Being able to get enough sleep on a regular basis has definitely improved my mood, especially after my anxieties were calmed by getting the vaccinations and boosters. I hope that more acceptance of the diversity of sleep styles remains a part of our culture, along with remote working and less commuting. I think it’s healthier for everyone. I look forward to seeing future studies on sleep and driving safety, for instance. I bet they’ll find less road rage, and fewer accidents overall, if folks aren’t so sleep deprived all the time.

Because I live in an apartment building with 8 college students (4 above, 4 below) and college classes were remote and pubs were close, they spend all their time (and their friends) at home.
Before Covid I got sleepy and got to bed around 11:30PM or 12PM, now I only go to bet around 1AM and sometimes only at 2PM.
Constant noises of people talking or furniture moving around has made me develop a severe case of paranoia that lead to anxiety and ence insonia.
This was made worse by construction work that started nearby and a ""warning horn"" that rang constantly.

2021,Pandemic,"Thanks a lot WION for covering this topic.
I suffered from mental health issues very early in my life and my family was extremely supportive.
I also got help and adequate treatment from a psychiatrist.
I had mood swings and was on the edge(could cry anytime) but the positive part was that I never had suicidal thoughts.I also wrote my HSC board exams under medication and took stabilisers too.
Ultimately, it all worked out and I have been leading a normal life without medication or any therapy for almost a year now. I have also become a much more confident and happy soul since then.😎
Trust yourself folks,all will be well and please ask for help if needed because there a lot people who stigmatize the issue but many people are understanding and helpful also..
Love and hope for everyone.😀

2021,Pandemic,"By personal experience, what majorly made improvement in me it was writing my thoughts out and understand them. I know it is hard you keep repeating those and those thoughts in your head but after that you start to listen to the pattern of your thought process. Talking to someone won't help you, they started to give their own experience and blah blah reasoning but it won't. Depression can be cured if you are willing to do it by yourself. Keep your mind no matter what listen to some good people, go for a run. Sweat yourself alot no matter if you don't want to get up. Just go outside of your room inhale 4 am morning breeze and if you can't handle people find your silent place away from your room it could be your roof too. Changing your surroundings helps alot. And write diary too. Everyday ask yourself WHAT YOU HAVE ACHIEVE TODAY. I know this process is excruciatingly painful and slow paced but even if your are taking first step to change that is applaudable. ❤️",joy

2021,Pandemic,"Those who have Apple TV watch what covid has done to our world.  Watching the documentary was an eye opener of why this was an meant to be we took our life as comfortable and never thought what we were doing to our world but nature took over and made 2020-2021 an unforgettable time in our world.   When we thought only of ourself and not “ WE” that meant our dying world that comprised of animals, pollution and better air to breathe watching the ocean and the changes that have taken place in the Oceans and as no ships in the oceans the fish and large mammals are having a time of their life,  watching the whales, the tortoise and all land creature walking our cities and most of all even the most dangerous animals are walking freely on our world busiest streets it was a joy and also a feel of dread that those who survive this will have bad memories and also see a new world.  Yesterday watching this I saw an Indian on this rooftop a photographer who for the first time saw the Himalayas  which is not near his place but kilometres from his rooftop and the joy on his face the pollution has so ebbed away that every side he turn he could see the top most highest peaks of the Himalayas which has not been seen for more that 30 to 40 years.  Birds are awaking earlier and as I am writing this from 2.30 am Indian standard time I am hearing the birds chirping and making such glorious sounds That we had forgotten existed with vehicle sounds and and people cutting down trees.  To hear this so early is such a wonderful feeling that life is taking a 360 degree turn and nature trying to balance our Earth every thing has changed.  Those who can watch this on Apple TV try to do so and you will be amazed by the feeling that one goes thru every second.  The chill down ones spine and the buoyancy of life that nature is exploding with animals that we forgot also own this world.  Please take your BP Tabs and anything that triggers anxiety because these documentaries work in many ways those who have lost dear ones and feel the emptiness left behind will not be able to take in the emotional change in our World.  Every scene is actually a very uncomfortable emotion that today because of all the negligence from all our actions so much lost and so much gained.  The backlash of covid in all its strains hopefully wakes up humanity what else will be in store of us if we don’t take care of our World.  The documentary itself is very self explanatory so those who don’t have Apply Tv try else where to watch these month by month changes going on, on Earth and the atmosphere",joy

For years, I had tried to persuade him to withdraw from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and stop being part of an organization that has committed countless crimes against its people. He always refused because he feared he might lose his pension. 

I ran into him a few days ago and asked him again to quit the CCP. I explained that it was inevitable the CCP would be held accountable for what it has done and I would hate to see such a kind person like him be implicated in its wrongdoings. I also said that I saw the coronavirus epidemic as a warning from heaven and that countries with close ties with the CCP have been hit the hardest by the outbreak.

This time, he listened very carefully and was very happy to quit the CCP. 

I met another elderly man outside a supermarket. When I told him about how the CCP has been persecuting Falun Gong, he said that he believed the epidemic was targeting the CCP and that it was the beginning of the end for it.

2021,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Any doctors out there that could provide advice specific to folks who have already recovered from moderate symptoms from COVID-19 infection? I am trying to decide between these vaccines. I realize the success and science of the mRNA vaccines make it an obvious choice. But almost everyone I know who has gone with those have had unfavorable (though still “mild”) reactions ranging from full body rashes, to fairly moderate Covid symptoms, that have lasted several days. The people I know who have had Covid and received these vaccines have RE-experienced a smaller but still significant version of their infection. Whereas, I’ve heard of no adverse reactions from those who have taken the J&J. Of course I want the maximum protection, but considering that the studies (and therefore success numbers) cannot be compared head to head, and that I have already some built up immunity, I am wondering if anyone has more educated insight into which option would be best.

Would it be more effective if given in multiple doses?",sadness

2021,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I am very Spiritual, and been practicing meditation over 20 years. I believe in and love Jesus Christ and believe the body to be a temple and dwelling place of Great Spirit. I don't attend church but i consider myself to be very close to the Lord and i definitely feel there should be a religious exemption one can sign up for or receive or get somehow. Religious or Spiritual people, or simply people who have deep beliefs about the body belonging to God etcetera, should not have to feel like or be mandated or forced to put anything in their bodies. The body is directly associated with profound and miraculous experiences. Some deeply religious and spiritual people have the ability to heal others, see visions and more. The state of mind and body should not be altered for such. Me personally i have truly had very loving and special experiences on my journey with getting to know the Lord and i do not want my body affected by anything or altered in any way. And i understand why others don't want to as well. Let us pray things change for us. I hope in Jesus  that we can all see good changes for God's people, and All people. Amen. ✨💜✨🙏❤️💕✨",joy

2021,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Good luck my dude. Though, agnosticism isn't really a religion, it's self sustained skepticism. But I digress. I'd probably try swinging article 11 of the 13 Articles of Faith within LDS dogma if needing a religious exemption. Hopefully it won't go that far. Much like the guy interviewed, I remain skeptical about the vaccine. Haven't heard enough good to convince me to get it. Have heard more than enough bad to avoid it & honestly wish the inverse were true, yet my overly analytical mind won't allow me to be so whimsical. 😕",joy

2021,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Beagles are treat monsters. I’ve owned a beagle since I was a little kid and found that it’s not a good idea to reinforce good behavior with treats. Beagles are very smart dogs and will realize very quickly that they get a treat for being good. Which isn’t always a bad thing but soon you’re beagle is going to expect to get a treat all the time just because it didn’t get into trouble. Beagles do have a tendency to gain weight if they don’t get proper exercise on a regular basis. Loading your dog up with treats is not beneficial to their health. It’s a much better idea to reinforce good behavior with showing your beagle ultimate affection. If he’s a good boy and behaves himself I tell him what a good boy he is and rub his belly, his sweet spot.",joy

2021,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"GREAT VIDEO!!  We have a “Beaglier”, Beagle and Cavalier King Charles mix - Macie Harper.  She has a lot of qualities of both breeds; however it is the Beagle side that drives us all nuts!!  We worked with a trainer for several months and had her mostly under control, but it is the barking that is still the problem. Our trainer said we had our hands full because in her 40 years of training, Macie Harper, was the smartest dog she had ever seen. In our first visit, 3 hours, Macie had “mastered” commands that usually take 2 weeks to 2 months for other dogs!!  We KNEW we were in trouble. We kept up training until our Trainer moved. We are not a diligent as we should be so the barking is an issue. I will TRY the “let them bark until they realize you will not respond” idea if my nerves and eardrum hold up.  Lots of good suggestions. THANK YOU!",joy

There are receptors on the heart for vaccine which are impacted with an intravenous injection of the vaccine.

2021,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Aussie abroad - Got my first dose, about to get my second. Had some muscle aches and fatigue the day after my first dose but all good thereafter.
Specifically for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the hospital I'm working at recommended people who have a known allergy to PEG (polyethylene glycol) wait for the AstraZeneca or J&J vaccines, and anyone with any other allergy history to be monitored for 30 mins after the vaccine (instead of the normal 15 mins). 
Since most of the reported allergic reactions happened within the first 30 min window, sticking around after the vaccine means the staff can treat you quickly if you happen to be the 'unlucky' allergy reaction.
Interesting note: reported severe allergic reactions (that lead to hospitalisations or death) happen at a lower rate than the annual death rate for motor vehicle accidents, bike accidents, pedestrian accidents, or dying from choking on food. (Annual death risk is from US data.) 
To put that into context, if you're traveling to get the vaccine and you stop by for a snack along the way, you've got a better chance of dying at any point in time before you get the vaccine than from the vaccine itself.",sadness

First shot: literally didn't feel it go in. Major tenderness on the arm for about 2-3 days. About 4-5 hours after I got the vaccine I had a couple small spurts where I felt lightheaded and not much else. Good to go.

Second Shot: Barely felt it go in. Same tenderness for 2-3 days. 
Day 1, I had nausea for about 3-4 hours and then it went away, no biggie. 
Day 2, It felt like an awful hangover the entire day. Cold sweats, no energy, chills, overall everything felt tender and slightly painful for the majority of the day and night. 
Day 3, most side effects wore off but still didn't have a ton of energy. 
Day 4, Completely back to normal and good to go back to the gym. Nothing since.

No opinion really on if you should or shouldn't get it. But if you do, just plan for a day or two of a nasty hangover effect after your second shot.

2021,Vaccines and Side Effects,"The donkey told the tiger, ""The grass is blue.""
The tiger replied, ""No, the grass is green,""
The discussion became heated,
and the two decided to submit the issue to arbitration, so they
approached the lion.
As they approached the lion on his throne, the donkey started
screaming: ""Your Highness, isn't it true that the grass is blue?""
The lion replied: ""f you believe it is true, the grass is blue.""
The donkey rushed forward and
continued: ""The tiger disagrees
with me, contradicts me and
annoys me. Please punish him.""

The king then declared: ""The tiger will be punished with 3 days of silence.""
The donkey jumped with joy and
went on his way, content and
repeating ""The grass is blue, the
grass is blue...""
The tiger asked the lion, ""Your
Majesty, why have you punished
me, after all, the grass is green?""
The lion replied, ""You've known
and seen the grass is green.""
The tiger asked, ""So why do you
punish me?""
The lion replied, ""That has nothing to do with the question of whether the grass is blue or green. The punishment is because it is
degrading for a brave, intelligent
creature like you to waste time
arguing with an ass, and on top of that, you came and bothered me with that question just to validate something you already knew was true!""
The biggest waste of time is
arguing with the fool and fanatic
who doesn't care about truth or
reality, but only the victory of his
beliefs and illusions. Never waste time on discussions that make no sense. There are people who, for all the evidence presented to them, do not have the ability to understand. Others who are blinded by ego, hatred and resentment, and the only thing that they want is to be right even if they aren't.

Shouldn't it become 100% mandatory for healthcare workers to report any possible adverse reactions that occur soon after tge jab?

2021,Vaccines and Side Effects,"13:20 I interpreted the rather confusing ""x =/- y"" as a typo of ""x +/- y"", which I take to mean ""an average of x with a range of plus or minus y"".  The average is assumed to be a first-order average (mean). Range could either mean the standard deviation, the extrema range (0-100th percentile), or the quarter range (25-75th percentile), or some arbitrary measure to indicate spread of value around the mean.
With this reading, ""35 =/- 20"" reads as an mean of 35 with standard deviation 20. Of course, the accuracy of this interpretation is guessed, but with this guess and the population size the statistical significance of the finding could be likewise estimated.
Having the full report with figures will be quite helpful to understand these values, but I can see why the abstract seemed to be written in a hurry.",joy

2021,Vaccines and Side Effects,"You give a demonstration about the importance of aspirating so as not to inject in the blood vessel, but you don't talk about the *dangers* of (what happens when) injecting the vaccine into the blood vessel?

If the MRNA vaccine is injected into a blood vessel free Spike protein is allowed to travel through the vascular walls, damaging them along the way creating blood clotting issues. The Spike protein has an affinity for reservoiring in the ovaries, the brain, and the heart. 

Obviously nurse Campbell doesn't want to talk about that because he's pro experimental vaccine all the way. Neat little demonstration but the viewers didn't learn squat about *why* it's important to aspirate, PARTICULARLY with the MRNA vaccines.",sadness

2021,Vaccines and Side Effects,"5:45 I disagree, because there are people who had zero doses of vaccine and didn't feel a thing during their infection, so it appears people who had 2 doses are sensitized to spike protein and are having mild allergic reaction which might become severe with each future vaccination.",sadness

I'm keeping my distance from others as a protection not just for myself but for them as well.  I pray that we all get through this.

2021,Vaccines and Side Effects,"For those of you who are doing research but are not used to analyzing studies/sources, here are four quick tips for determining if the study is valid. First, check who paid for the study. Any private funding has to be disclosed in most journals. If it is funded by a group that may have alternative purposes (for example, an artificial sweetener study funded by the sugar association) be extremely skeptical. The results could be highly biased. Second, check for conflicts of interest. This again has to be listed in most journals, and will also tell you if the results may be biased to serve a special interest ( to continue the example, the main investigator has a large share of stock in the sugar industry). Third, check sample size. In statistics, there is a term known as ""type 1 error"" which basically means that a person concluded he/she/they found a result where a result doesn't exist. The smaller the sample size, the more likely this mistake is to happen.  The proper sample size depends on the study. For medical studies, for initial studies it should be in the 20-80, then increased to a couple hundred, then thousand if possible.  Lastly, check how many times that particular paper has been cited, and check out how it is being cited. This is a good indicator of if the information provided in the study was found to be scientifically significant. If it is cited a lot in publications aiming to disprove it, it is probably not a good study to base your information on.",joy

When I got pregnant, they decided it wouldn't be a good idea to give me a Tdap while pregnant. After giving birth, I saw an immunologist and discovered that the pertussis vaccine I had a bad reaction to was no longer the one they give. I got the acellular pertussis vaccine with no issue between pregnancies and will be able to get the Tdap with my second child.

She's naturally rowdy and doesn't listen much, pair this with teachers who aren't with accustomed to teaching online and she rarely learns anything. Her parents are at work all day long and her grandparents don't speak english. The only time she ever actually learns something is when I drive over to help, but I am busy most of the time as well.

2021,COVID-19 and School,"As someone who is a student (Highschool specifically) tbh I really wish we could be fully in school all the time. I feel as though I haven't learned anything so far this year. My core classes have been cut in half and we now only have them for half of the year for each one. This is causing us to have to speedrun an entire year's worth of the subject in only half the time. We barely spend time on a single part of a subject and me and some of my friends all agree we haven't been able to retain any knowledge. I almost failed two classes I am normally great at because of the sheer speed we go over things, and I am in CP classes which are the lowest level classes at my school where we are supposed to go over things slower than say an honors class. The school system where I am is trying its best but what they have done to our schedule hasn't (as far as I know) helped any student or teacher very much. Even on the one or two days, we get to go to school in a week, we are only there for the length of a half-day. In which while it does give us time with our teachers, it doesn't really work fairly with the people who must remain home and do the class over remote. The teachers have to try and teach both people from home and the ones at school and it is giving them a hard time to try and teach this way. Some classes at my school don't even work well with the system and the people at home end up on their own until the 30 minute afternoon time they have with the teacher. I understand that this is how things must be, but it's really screwing over teachers and students alike. I just hope this pandemic will be over soon so I can go back to my normal classes and feel as though I have actually learned something.",sadness

opinion the schools are re-opening

job as a parent. They want the teachers to do it all. Sure you
have to provide for your children.
God forbid that your child gets
sick. You will still have to stay
off your job to see about them.
Most parents would regret sending
them back to school. There are more
concerns about opening up 
businesses to help the economy.
Little to No concern about people
losing their lives, due to the virus.

think about the choices you make

much time as you can with them.

2021,COVID-19 Research,"The novel coronavirus broke out in late 2019, and after a slight break in the summer of 2020, it returned at the end of last year with new mutated strains that significantly increased infection and death rates. Even with a mask, one could breathe the fear of the unknown in the air.

From ancient times to the modern day, several prophecies point to a catastrophic and deadly plague around this time. Now the pressing question before us is: How big will the current coronavirus plague get? If the future is as tragic as described in the prophecies, how can one survive it?

To find the answer, we can look to some clues from the great plagues of ancient Rome about two thousand years ago.

Persecution of Christians and Plagues in Ancient Rome
In 33 A.D., after Jesus was put to death in the province of Judea, some of his followers witnessed the miracle of Jesus' resurrection. The number of Christians kept increasing after that.

On July 17, 64 AD, a fire broke out in the ancient city of Rome, engulfing the whole city. In the flames, some people witnessed Nero, the fifth emperor of ancient Rome, standing at the top of a tower, playing the lyre and singing folk songs about the fall of Troy. The fire burned for six days and seven nights.

After the incident, Nero insisted that the arsonists were Christians and began to arrest them, calling them “cultists.” Although many people believed that Nero had ordered the army to set the fire, they were afraid and unwilling to look into the truth in the face of Nero's tyranny.

Immediately afterward, various rumors about Christians' “baby-killing,” “binge drinking,” and “incestuous behavior” began to fly, and the public began to despise and hate Christians. Riding on this “public opinion,” Nero's persecution of Christians became even more unscrupulous.

The ancient Roman historian Tacitus described the following in his Annals: “In their very deaths they were made the subjects of sport: for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts, and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and when the day waned, burned to serve for the evening lights. Nero offered his own garden players for the spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the dress of a charioteer, or else standing in his chariot.”

Most of the people of ancient Rome at the time applauded the horrific persecution of Christians.

In 65 A.D., a plague broke out in the city, claiming more than 30,000 lives. This plague was, in fact, a prelude to a series of plagues that struck ancient Rome. In 68 A.D., a riot broke out in Rome and Nero ended his brutal life by stabbing his own throat with a dagger. However, the outbreak of the plague and the tragic death of Nero did not provoke much reflection among the ancient Romans.

In 79 A.D., an even larger plague quickly swept through Rome. According to Tacitus, at its peak, more than 10,000 people died every day. Houses were filled with corpses, and the streets were filled with lines for funerals. The plague also took the life of then-emperor Titus. This plague, although fierce, was not ranked among the four great plagues of ancient Rome.

After the death of Titus, his successor Domitian did not restrain himself and instead forced people to worship him as “Lord and God.” He persecuted those Christians who did not want to do so. The emperor Trajan, who came after Domitian, intensified the persecution of the Christians and killed Ignatius, the second bishop of Antioch, by having him torn apart by a fierce beast.

In 125 A.D., the Plague of Orosius broke out, accompanied by swarms of locusts.",sadness

To find the answer, we can look to some clues from the great plagues of ancient Rome about two thousand years ago.

Persecution of Christians and Plagues in Ancient Rome
In 33 A.D., after Jesus was put to death in the province of Judea, some of his followers witnessed the miracle of Jesus' resurrection. The number of Christians kept increasing after that.

On July 17, 64 AD, a fire broke out in the ancient city of Rome, engulfing the whole city. In the flames, some people witnessed Nero, the fifth emperor of ancient Rome, standing at the top of a tower, playing the lyre and singing folk songs about the fall of Troy. The fire burned for six days and seven nights.

After the incident, Nero insisted that the arsonists were Christians and began to arrest them, calling them “cultists.” Although many people believed that Nero had ordered the army to set the fire, they were afraid and unwilling to look into the truth in the face of Nero's tyranny.

Immediately afterward, various rumors about Christians' “baby-killing,” “binge drinking,” and “incestuous behavior” began to fly, and the public began to despise and hate Christians. Riding on this “public opinion,” Nero's persecution of Christians became even more unscrupulous.

The ancient Roman historian Tacitus described the following in his Annals: “In their very deaths they were made the subjects of sport: for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts, and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and when the day waned, burned to serve for the evening lights. Nero offered his own garden players for the spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the dress of a charioteer, or else standing in his chariot.”

Most of the people of ancient Rome at the time applauded the horrific persecution of Christians.

In 65 A.D., a plague broke out in the city, claiming more than 30,000 lives. This plague was, in fact, a prelude to a series of plagues that struck ancient Rome. In 68 A.D., a riot broke out in Rome and Nero ended his brutal life by stabbing his own throat with a dagger. However, the outbreak of the plague and the tragic death of Nero did not provoke much reflection among the ancient Romans.

In 79 A.D., an even larger plague quickly swept through Rome. According to Tacitus, at its peak, more than 10,000 people died every day. Houses were filled with corpses, and the streets were filled with lines for funerals. The plague also took the life of then-emperor Titus. This plague, although fierce, was not ranked among the four great plagues of ancient Rome.

After the death of Titus, his successor Domitian did not restrain himself and instead forced people to worship him as “Lord and God.” He persecuted those Christians who did not want to do so. The emperor Trajan, who came after Domitian, intensified the persecution of the Christians and killed Ignatius, the second bishop of Antioch, by having him torn apart by a fierce beast.

In 125 A.D., the Plague of Orosius broke out, accompanied by swarms of locusts.",sadness

Once the B cells are making antibodies, what is shed won't contain much infesctious virus as the viral particles will be covered in antibodies.

The new research for me/CFS is promising yet beyond infuriating. The funding 

 just hasn’t been there for medical staff to fully grasp and understand ME/CFS. Patients gave therefore been denied help and been miss understood by medical staff for years and years.

Yes, Long Covid is real and debilitating.

I got covid end of August and though it was initially a mild to moderate illness I am far from fully recovered.

But what I have learned in a lightbulb type moment by this 'long covid' is that my chronic fatigue for the last 40 odd years - that  no doctor had ever took seriously must be post viral.

Something I did always suspect actually.

Hooray that now people like you are talking about it...hopefully us Chronic Fatigue sufferers will be exonerated from being labelled as 'all in the mind' or whatever.

The symptoms and side effects of battling covid is profound.

Losing taste and smell is truly awful.

I have been trying to find a support group to talk about the impact of this virus.

It causes a lot of psychological disturbance too. Anxiety...fear even.

Having gotten through covid and long haul covid  I would tell everyone who gets covid to take total rest from the onset. If you don't the virus will knock you back down even harder.

I have dogs who needed walking but negotiating 5 flights of stairs to let them out hampered my recovery.

I have watched a few personal stories now... I think the key is rest. Total rest. It seems to me that those who tried to soldier on and be active put themselves at even greater risk of this virus taking hold.

It's like nothing I ever experienced before.

My immune system seems to be perhaps 75% tricked into rebooting (that's what it felt like when some ""systems"" came back online normally) after vaccine but I still have lingering Cardiac & GI issues every day.

2021,COVID-19 and Society,"Good afternoon!!!  PM Modi I have a suggestion to send a project: 

1*  - Maybe an option is a world decree, for cemetery projects in a desert location, maybe this is a strategy to ward off the pandemic, I mean separating the dead from the cities, disable  all cemeteries in all cities, transferring all cemeteries to the desert is an ideal environment for building cemeteries. 

 2 * - Bearing in mind: Two quality of cemetery 

1 - Cemetery for people who died without any covid19 disease 

2 - Cemetery for people who are victims of covid19 

3 - The choice of procedure is up to the dead person.  example: Chose an option still in life. 

 4 - Options for mummification or options.  

5 options for keeping a corpse;  examples: Formaldehyde, Chemicals for preserving corpses 

6 - Options for cremation of corpses

 7 - These procedures can be excellent for us to be able to overcome the wave of epidemiology of covid19. 

 8 - World decree to disable all cemeteries in all cities. 
 
10 - The Project is to build non-perishable food stores in the desert border, so the food stores are for emergency use.  But if the event of the resurrection of the dead happens, it is not necessary for the dead to invade cities to look for food.  They can eat barn food
11- It is an infallible project we will store drinking water too
12 - The project focuses on keeping track of everything in order and the law
13 - I will send all the project pages soon",sadness

2021,COVID-19 and Society,"*I have good news for you!*

Your death has been paid! What death?
*The death of sin.* _Because the wage of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord_ – *Romans 6:23*
_For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus_ – *Romans 3:23-24*

_Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned_ – *Romans 5:12*

Through Adam death, *through Jesus Life* 
_Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life_ – *Romans 5:18*

So, what is the point of this good news? *The Gospel of Salvation* - the Gospel means „Good news“ in Greek language.

*What is the Gospel of Salvation/Good news?*

_Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures_ – *1Corinthians 15:1-4*

He, fully man and fully God, paid, to give you this gift of Eternal Life. Why He did it? *Because He loves!* - _For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life_ – *John 3:16*

_For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him_ – *2Corinthians 5:21*

Jesus Christ said: _I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me_ – *John 14:6*
Believe what He did on the cross for you and you will be saved. *He is waiting for you!*

*What should I do to become a child of God?*

*A* – Admit you are a sinner in need of a Savior. As it is written: _There is non righteous, no, not one_ – *Romans 3:10.* _For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God_ – *Romans 3:23*

*B* – Believe on finished redemptive work of Jesus Christ on the Cross – _Christ died for your sins, was buried and third day He rose again_ – *1Cor 15:1-4 Gospel of Salvation.* If you want to enter to the Kingdom of Heaven, you must have a faith like a child – children trust their parents. Why I mentioned parents? Because God is our Creator; He is our Father; He is our Parent - _Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart_ – *Jeremiah 1:5*

*C* – Call on the name of the Lord and you will be saved - _If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved_ – *Romans 10:9-10.* _For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved_ – *Romans 10:13*

Jesus Christ is the shower/water that cleans us of all unrighteousness. _Come now, let us settle the matter, says the Lord. Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; thought they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool_ - *Isaiah 1:18*

Finally admitted to A&E in hospital where I stayed for almost a week. My most serious concern was that I couldn't breathe. I dared not sleep for a few days for fear of not being able to ever get up again. This was the time when one hears of many deaths from covid all over the place.

Will probably update this if I don't have long Covid which I hope I don't. 

Been seeing a lot of people say that sensory loss is common with this variant.

Hopefully all this goes away. I pray that anyone who gets it doesn't get these symptoms. If you don't have it please stay away from sick people if you can and WASH YOUR HANDS and anything else you touch before touching face. Definitely want to avoid this variant.",sadness

Day 3: Woke up feeling much better. A bit of runny nose and scratchy throat. No cough and fever and headache and chills seems to be gone. Feel like in a couple days I'll feel 100%.

No matter what I drank or how much. Extremely cold that night, couldn’t sleep. Next day chills 10x worse, strained eyes. It hurt to look side to side. Fever of 100-101 with one you put in your mouth. 102 with the one you put to your forehead. As time went on I had a runny nose. Cough with mucus! Consistently swallowing mucus!

The worst for me is the headaches and the first day body pain but tylenol works fine. Me and the girls are on day 3 and husband on day seven. Us girls are pretty much back to normal except nose irritation and tired for me. Insomnia as well the first night. The girls only symptoms have been fevers that have gone down immediately with tylenol and motrin every other dose. I've had cold and flus way worse than this honestly. The biggest thing for me is these headaches bc they are so different than what I'm used to getting which is what's throwing me for a loop. No fever or anything of that sort for me just the kids.

2022,COVID-19,"Had Covid in July 2020, haven’t been the same since. Prior to Covid, I’d had Lyme/CFS and some other issues so I was no stranger to brain fog but this is different. Covid left me with relentless migraines that felt like my brain was going to explode for many days on end. Fluvoxamine helped tremendously with the migraines and feeling of my brain being swollen but the side effects were really annoying. Things that I was previously good at, I’m not great at anymore. My sense of direction is not as good, I’m far clumsier, fine motor skills and spatial awareness are both diminished. Word recall and vocabulary have suffered. Then there’s the personality changes. I used to be funny, extroverted and sociable, I’m not anymore. Nothing really brings me much joy, it’s like I’m not making dopamine or seratonin. Food doesn’t taste as good, my sense of smell is still stronger than most people’s but it’s definitely diminished from what it was. I just feel like a hollow shell of the person I was before. 

I try to fake my way through life and act normal but I don’t want to live like this for a lifetime. There’s so many of us who are suffering this hell and we really need help from Drs and scientists that are willing to take us seriously.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,I had Covid in January. After recovering I noticed I had what some have called brain fog. I really had trouble concentrating. For the record I do a lot of working out. Primarily aerobic but also some weights too. I decided to see if I could use my workouts to help. I decided to try this since I have experienced in the past how a good cardio workout really seems to clean out my system. I went and did two days of really hard cardio. I absolutely murdered it hard as I could for several miles. Particularly the second day. Brain fog was gone and haven’t seen it since. Don’t know if this could help someone else but it is my experience.,joy
2022,COVID-19,I had covid in early July of this year and since then I have not been the same! I’ve had major brain fog and probably the worst thing I developed was insomnia from it. It has truly affected my mood/personality. I went from being such a motivated person who was really active to someone who now suffers from depression & anxiety. It truly has changed who I am. Everyday is a struggle when before I never had an issue. I really hope everything gets better for everyone suffering. It truly has crippled my life in a way but I’m learning how to live with it. Prayers for everyone.,sadness

Their compassionate hearts are both evident and commendable!  I truly hope medicine and future medical practitioners will use these physicians as “role models”!  We need to encourage physicians/researchers to continue such compassionate, fruitful work and dedication to their patients…not just monetary gain or prestige!  We cannot reward or permit the medical staff, medical companies, hospitals, pharmaceutical, and medical interest groups and businesses within the entire medical framework benefit from patients’ illness and perpetual suffering!!

Involuntarily swallowing (!) started. My tongue and jaw started to loosen. It is unseen. I felt like there was a tremor and tension through my throat-esophagus track. After losing 15 pounds, 3-4 weeks later i got little better and gained my appetite, but then i spit light red blood with stomachache and throatache. I did endoscopy immediately but they didn't find anything. Then everything got worse. I lost my appetite for good over a year. I am experiencing a worsening throatache that no ENT professors can detect with camera. I have examined by over 60 professors. Gastroenterologists, ENT Professors, Neurologists etc.. i did blood tests, endoscopies, colonoscopy, CTs, MRs even EMGs. Throat pain is killing me.

High fevers for over 2 weeks, our legs having purple spots ( apparently our blood was coagulating ), couldn’t eat or drink . My sister lips were blue and mine as well . My mom with COVID was trying to help me when she saw I was struggling to breathe and I was trembling. She called 911. I was hospitalized the most since I have asthma and ended up getting pneumonia. I was on so much medication that my liver hurt. Took me 3 months to mostly recover . I noticed since then I have brain fog, I constantly now cough, trouble breathing, lose energy quickly , random moments my heart starts beating like crazy . I also for 2 years struggled with my mental health.( having horrible thoughts to end my life) . My dad and little sister have similar symptoms after COVID . It’s crazy how this virus has ruined so many lives. My uncle wasn’t so lucky . After being intubated for a month , he passed away… I attended on zoom over 10 funerals of family and friends who passed away from COVID .

He seemed to recover but he suddenly couldn't digest his food and has lost 70 pounds in the last few months. He can't eat anything solid. He told me that he tried to eat a few slices of well ripened mango but he vomited several hours later and it was completely undigested as if he had just sliced it. His doctors have ruled out physiological problems and are now treating it as a psychological problem. He's 60 years old and has never had problems related to stress. He's always been a laid back guy, generally positive, likes to crack jokes and active in church. He's also having heart problems. I feel so bad for him because he was very cautious during the pandemic but he had to take our mother to the hospital for skin cancer treatment that couldn't wait during the peak of the pandemic in New Mexico and both he and our mother caught covid, probably at the hospital. I hope this research can help him. Thank you.",sadness

I couldn't read more than a few words at a time and my ears were ringing unbearably.  
I sat down and focused on reading a couple of paragraphs  at a time a couple of times a day until I finally started to improve and things got better from there. 
Getting over the ringing ears was way more complicated. All I can say on that was I began working on it by noticing that the intensity would change depending when I would shift my focus. I ran across a video about a tinnitus fix that involved tapping on the back of my own head. 
The more to think about the ringing and the more that you pay attention to it will only increase the misery.  If it's driving you nuts I recommend looking for anything that distracts your attention away from it.",sadness

No one I know has ever been tested, either, I’ve asked many people, wondering if this was just Kaiser being super-cheap on testing.

The neurological symptoms (as well as the vast majority of deaths) are caused by anxiety stress and stress hormones, their long term effects as well as acute anxiety during infection (cortisol and adrenaline). The symptoms are identical to those of panic disorder and MDD.
The virus itself doesn't kill - or only after severe immune inhibition due to cortisol and anti-inflammatory Cytokines, leading to pneumonia. People die from anxiety caused circulatory distress (mainly elderly and heart patients), the influence of corticosteroids on metabolism (diabetes patients) and most importantly false response due to misdiagnosis of anxiety caused breathing problems, which they ""treat"" by intubation and multi-week general anaesthesia (""induced coma"") of the high-risk group for propofol-induced death.
And I can prove everything I claim with 100% certainty. Contact me for any questions.",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"If this pandemic teaches us to turn to God,
why do churches close down and were more vulnerable as we go to church ?

If this pandemic shows us that family is
important why is it harder to visit family
members and why are we losing them ?

Even if we all struggle with
the pandemic and what's going on
around the world we struggle together,
especially for some lives affected
permanently now. My concern is that when the pandemic is over, some people are happy and some people are sad. I feel that if the pandemic is over some people will be ok and some lives are permanently affected and that's not fair. Some people may feel that they’re struggling alone.

If life tells us to move on from certain things, why did the pandemic limit us from moving forward with these restrictions and why do us desires get controlled. If we limit ourselves from things on earth and our desires it’s like we’re not having any variety and staying in the same place which is also like not moving on

In life if we have to surrender some things we have to get what we want, To be honest it's like hard to keep track of every we have and desire because life is full of variety. Just like how you check the
storage on your phone and see oh I have so many megabytes and this app has so many megabytes and it's taking up my storage, it's not like we can do the same thing with everything we have and desire in our personal life like our house, belongings or anything we enjoy",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"""Perhaps those would not understand the truth from their Lord, except with a painful torment of partners, would like to say: “O Nasser Mohammed al-Yamani, we are sick of hearing you rave about this news for 17 years, saying: "" O mankind, indeed I am the caliph of Allaah , and His servant Imam Mahdi, on the whole world and that Allaah will achieve His purpose. O man, we are sick and tired of your rave about this news for seventeen years, and you have been frightening us with the punishment of Allaah if we do not worship Him alone, no partners Has He, and follow the fundamental verses of the Book in the Great Qur’an, and you have been striving diligently against us with it. What is wrong with you man? Do not you ever get bored? Your statements are published everywhere on Google and all different social media platforms but still, no one believed you in the world except for a few men and women among different populations, If only Allaah would torment us to believe you?"" Then Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani replies to you and says: O decision-makers, the staff of their governments and all their peoples, why do you want not to use your minds, hoping from Allaah if I was truly the Caliph of Allaah, Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, to let you believe the truth from your Lord before the torment of disgrace from the Lord of the worlds?! And I see that you are insisting to be punished by Allaah if Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani was truly Allaah's caliph on the worlds and I would like to ask you how do you want to be punished by Allaah? Because If I warned you of the lesser torment of Allaah through pouring floods, tsunamis, and fiery whirlwinds that ignite trees then mushrooms fire towards homes, in addition to earthquakes that make you run out of your houses, or when Allaah increases the intensity of earthquakes to reach 24 on the Richter scale so houses are collapsed over whoever Allaah wills among you ;thus they cannot escape due to the rapidity of the destruction of houses, those who deny Allaah (atheists) whether they are disbelievers or Muslims among astronomers and climatologists will say: ""These are natural disasters because of climate changes""; as a result, those who do not use their minds will call them natural disasters like you did and indeed they are like cattle ,with all due respect to cattle when compared to them but they are even more astray than cattle, have they created the heavens and earth or have they acquired control over them?! Hence, no matter how Allaah torments you through air, sea, or land atheists among mankind will keep calling them: ""Natural disasters"" until Allaah destroys them joining the wicked with each other, heaping them all together, and puts them into the fire, therefore they say: ""Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!""

2022,COVID-19,Brave and  courageous. My son accidentally swabbed his nose instead of his mouth. He turned away for privacy and I was busy swabbing my mouth. Anyway later on that evening he asked me if my nose was runny because he was annoyed his had been since the test. That's how I found out. So I end up calling the next day to ask if he'd need to reschedule and no one had an answer. I was so pissed how serious and contagious this virus had been ingrained into our brain yet no one could answer my questions?  He needed to be cleared for school and I went back and we both got retested. He did his correct this time and was negative. I dipped mine in my water bottle....

I got  COVID-19 three weeks ago (in Northern IL), but I don't know which circulating variant I got (BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, BA.4.6, BA.5). Will acquired immunity against one of these be sufficient against the others, or would the bivalent vaccine give additional protection?

As for me, I have some comorbidities to consider, and I had some mild but odd combination of symptoms that some are saying the current variants might not have (night sweats AND anosmia/parosmia/phantosmia), so that can't guide my guess. And I still tested faintly positive 3 weeks after my initial positive test and I still have some mild symptoms, although x-ray report says it's a mild viral pneumonia secondary infection.",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"Hi, I have a question based on the graph you showed regarding the dominance of different variances across time. My understanding is that this is alternavility is in part due to evolutionary process which becomes quite evident given that virus reproduce at such high rates; however through the different vacciness we are also playing a big role in this process, right? Vacciness might deminish prevalence of certain strands, but this aids other strands (of which are plenty) existent or to come to take over that spot. Honestly, it looks to me like a lost cause, wouldnt be advisable to focus vaccination in the most catastrophic strands as a mean to favor more benign ones (under the assumption that what I said previously approaches reality).",joy

2022,COVID-19,"Thanks for telling people to tell them what medications they're on first. I had problems with meds interactions long before COVID started and was first put on psych meds without anyone taking into account that I had asthma and asthmatic allergies.  I never had a medication allergy because I had been on less than five meds in my life. So, they didn't think to tell me that important part about keeping track of what I was on at all times.

Each time I was in and out of the ER, I took all my meds and threw them into a lunch bag and handed it to them. But, the first time I went my ambulance and didn't have that. I was so drugged up and sleep deprived that I couldn't remember what I was on for what.  My PSYCH APRN from the psych clinic never looked at my intake form before prescribing meds and called my symptoms psychosomatic or not serious enough to have a med change yet.  My throat felt slightly tighter every hour. I had trouble swallowing food. I kept using my inhaler. And, between the insomnia and symptoms that felt like Tardive Disconesia - I couldn't even think straight enough to pull my inhaler out of my purse and letting them see I have needed inhalers for over a decade. Everything got worse because I didn't know what I was on to tell people.

If I had a list with current meds and current conditions before going to the ER, I wouldn't have had to guess and getting the wrong med put in my report.

I have a free app called Medisafe that not only helps me keep track of all of my Bipolar meds, I can record all the specifics on the med dosage, info, and how many pills I have left.

It has an alarm that sounds like a baby rattle when it's time to take my meds. The app saves me at every doctor appointment and I haven't missed a single med since I downloaded it. The only drawback is that it doesn't recognize generic medication and will only take the brand name. But, you can put the generic name in the notes section.

You probably saved a person from having a nightmare by adding that reminder about drug interactions and listing current meds.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,What I would have liked in addition to drug interactions and allergies is the note that people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should definitely a) tell their doctor/pharmacist that they are pregnant (/may be pregnant) and/or breastfeeding and b) consult their doctor/pharmacist before taking any of the antiviral pills regarding their (potential) pregnancy/breastfeeding (since at least some - not sure if all - of the pills can have severe consequences for the child),ambiguous

Add on top of it that we had to vacate our apartment two months ago because of flooding while we waited for our new place we have to open on Saturday.

No hug and thanks for taking us in, just waving from my car window and waiting until we test negative and have no symptoms.

""Behold, speak thou in the ears of my people the words of prophecy, which I will put in thy mouth, saith the Lord: And cause them to be written in paper: for they are faithful and true. 

Fear not the imaginations against thee, let not the incredulity of them trouble thee, that speak against thee. For all the unfaithful shall die in their unfaithfulness.

Behold, saith the Lord, I will bring plagues upon the world; the sword, famine, death, and destruction.  For wickedness hath exceedingly polluted the whole earth, and their hurtful works are fulfilled.

Therefore saith the Lord, I will hold my tongue no more as touching their wickedness, which they profanely commit, neither will I suffer them in those things, in which they wickedly exercise themselves: behold, the innocent and righteous blood cries unto me, and the souls of the just complain continually.

And therefore, saith the Lord, I will surely avenge them, and receive unto me all the innocent blood from among them.""

Isaiah 28: 14-22
“Hear the word of the Lord, O scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem. 

For you said, 
‘We have made a covenant with death; we have fashioned an agreement with Sheol. When the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not touch us, because we have made lies our refuge and falsehood our hiding place.” 

So this is what the Lord GOD says: 
“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; the one who believes will never be shaken. I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the level. 

Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies, and water will flood your hiding place. Your covenant with death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled by it. As often as it passes through, it will carry you away; it will sweep through morning after morning, by day and by night.” 

The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror. Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket too small to wrap around you. 

For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim. He will rouse Himself as in the Valley of Gibeon, to do His work, His strange work, and to perform His task, His disturbing task. 

So now, do not mock, or your shackles will become heavier. Indeed, I have heard from the Lord GOD of Hosts a decree of destruction against the whole land.”

Psalms 101:6-8 
""My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, That they may dwell with me; He who walks in a perfect way, He shall serve me. He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house; He who tells lies shall not continue in my presence. 

Every morning I will ferret out all the wicked of the land, That I may cut off all the evildoers from the city of the Lord.""",joy

I had the first vaccine and since omicron is the reading source of Covid right now I want to get the booster as the second vaccine does not protect against the newer versions of Covid. But I still have to get the whole series before I can get the booster.",joy

2022,COVID-19,"My 68 yo uncle got sick from C-19 before vaccines, again after getting two shots, and again after getting a booster. He eventually got a blood test after the 3rd time and his Vitamin D level was so low that his doctor put him on 10,000 IU a day for a few weeks...that's 10-11 times the daily recommended dosage for a man his age.  Meanwhile, my 71 yo mom is unvaxxed yet has been keeping up her Vitamin C, D, and zinc levels up daily and in the past 3 years the only illness she has had is a slight common cold for 2 days....and she has been going out in the public (restaurants, churches, ball games) probably 10 times more than my uncle.

2022,COVID-19,"Thank you for the good news that research is showing about fighting COVID! I'm an Infection Preventionist (RN) in a large LTC where although we've done really well during the pandemic, the DOH and CMS will never let go control over this nightmare. We're governed by people who don't look at what's really going on in terms of true non-political research results, which is really sad for our elderly residents and our staff.  I'm so glad to have people like you, who are literally boots on the ground, giving us pearls of true scientific data to review and digest. It makes so much sense too, about children, but you don't hear about it from the CDC. I've always said that this is not a pandemic affecting children and we all should be thanking God for that!! But in LTC, it's always winter, never Christmas for anyone. Have to wait to get below 10 cases/100,000 for any relief.

2022,COVID-19,"I am a nurse and have worked as a missionary in a lifestyle center in Colorado where we helped patients with chronic diseases, specially cancer patients and we used daily hydrotherapy on them, whether it was a fever bath, a contrast shower, or a foot bath, sitz bath and many other things, the results were always amazing! More energy, regulated sleep, mood, hunger…
As a matter of fact, I tested positive for Covid today. Had 104°F fever yesterday, was struggling to lower it, than I did a contrast shower and that’s when I started to feel better. I feel 100% today! 
Hydrotherapy works and it is not a thing of the past.",joy

2022,COVID-19,I will share. I think being well rested and hydrated goes a long way. It seems like I've been able to hold off getting a cold for a long time just paying attention to how hydrated or under hydrated I become when exposed to viruses. I'm a sensitive person though and pay a lot of attention inward.,joy

2022,COVID-19,"I'm 76 years old, had three pfizer covid vaccines and have so far avoided getting sick with covid.  My husband and I are fairly isolated on our farm which may help.  As a child, when we got sick, my mother had us drink large glasses of HOT lemonade and then go to bed with multiple blankets/quilts, sweat profusely and sleep.  We got over whatever we had - didn't see doctors back then.  I had the flu once at age 10 years and have never had it since.  We keep up on vitamins (my Vit. D level is 51), eat freshly cooked food at home (very little ""processed"" foods), and work outside most days.  I think the hot lemonade and going to bed with multiple blankets to sweat and sleep must have helped boost interferon levels and knocked the socks off whatever bug we had as kids.  At 76 with my husband 83, we need to help our innate systems as much as possible!",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"The swiss cheese graphic is an excellent way of illustrating how to protect ourselves in a pandemic or even from a less lethal viral infection. This compliment is supported by the fact I had to take 2 (school year) semesters and one-half (summer) semester to get a passing grade in my college biology class, yet I grasped the essentials of personal and shared responsibilities of protection. Too late to raise my cumulative grade average, but still time to increase my knowledge.",joy

2022,COVID-19,"Back in November and December of 2019, a lot of the Chinese students in our area were feeling poorly and getting a weird dry cough. The folks working at our store caught this ""three week cough"" too, and some of us got very sick and were out for days.I eventually got it too, in December, and had terrible chills and fever. I wrapped up warm under blankets with the heat going at 80 F or so, and just rested and stayed hydrated and fed. 

My lungs kept feeling more and more like I could not breathe, but no mucus which freaked me out. I put a heating pad on my chest. After a few hours, my breathing eased but I kept using the heating pad because it still felt good. The fever broke that night, and after that I was okay; although I stayed home and rested for a couple more days. (And I had the dry cough for three weeks, like all my coworkers.)",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"Thank you so much Dr. Seheult. I got Covid last December, a milder case than many. I am 70, very active and fit for my age, outside walking a lot and taking the full range of supplements for about a year prior. Your video on “10 Things You Can Do” on Cov-19 really helped me.

Three days ago I was suddenly overwhelmed with tiredness, fever and dry cough. I’ve been vaccinated so I figured it was probably a flu of some sort, just went to bed and feel almost normal today. But you bet if I would have known this about hydrotherapy I’d have had several baths by now. Not great news about Omicron this fall but my husband and I will continue to learn all we can from your good work and amazingly calm, confident and kind demeanor.",joy
2022,COVID-19,"Some very interesting information. I tend to agree that aggressively managing the fever symptoms tends to slow down recovery. I still feel there is a place for analgesia. Seeking other ways to strengthen recovery also improves recovery, moving about a little, getting some fresh air and sun exposure, being properly hydrated, keeping a positive attitude - people phoning occasionally to check on you, Vit D and Zinc. With a fever you just have to change your PJs more often and bedlinen especially if they are saturated from overnight bed rest - you don't need a chill. For myself  with COVID the high fever only lasted probably a couple of hours on the night of the day I first noticed the symptoms. I felt worryingly congested and didn't sleep. On the second night I was still congested, sore throat and coughing, but managed some sleep. There's a bit of a way to go, but I feel I may have turned the corner.",sadness

In the winter it is close to 32 - 36 F (0 C- 2.2C) .  plus taking very hot showers,  then finish by cold water.  Got Omicron several months ago,  and mild cold like symptoms.  even kept my work outs going.  My 41 year old daughter also got it,  was getting sicker.  I told her to do the hot shower, then as cold as she could stand.  she did ice cold water  for 2 mins a few times and within a couple of days, felt great.  I am sold.",sadness

This has been happening for at least the past 2-3 years and is still very noticeable. I'm an older person, and its particularly noticeable in healthcare. I chalked this up to the general trauma and distraction of pandemic but now I am beginning to wonder if there are just loads of employees who are fumbling in the workplace due to having had CV.  If so, this is another layer of sadness to this whole ordeal we are all experiencing.",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"I had COVID early in the pandemic. March 2020. Even now  I have a persistent “brain fog”. Even what I would call “post stroke” like impairments to my thought process. What scares me, as a COVID unit nurse, is what I have seen in my patients. There are many that cannot process even some of the simplest information during their admissions and at discharge. Young or old, COVID impacts their ability to process information. It shows no mercy. Even worse, many of the admissions with COVID, are fully vaccinated, and have had boosters. This virus has had a deep impact on humanity that I feel we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at this time.",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"This is definitely a real thing.  I have felt fatigued and 'foggy' for about 4 1/2 months since I got over the worst symptoms from contracting some form of the virus at the end of last May.  During the 7 or 8 days I was particularly ill from this infection, I could sense that both my brain and peripheral nervous system were affected.  Besides my extremely sensitive skin and cognitive malfunctioning, I also had some GI issues.  While those symptoms are mostly gone, I am currently battling the chronic fatigue and a sense of depression that I cannot seem to shake.  My psycho-motor and physical co-ordination abilities have also been adversely affected.  This is real - and it's no fun.",sadness

2022,COVID-19,"I caught an unlabelled virus in about 1998 and since then have had chronic fatigue syndrome/ME, my friend was also affected by the same virus and developed fibromyalgia. Now I have retired I can function well as I’m less often overloaded, but my worst symptom was always brain fog and muscle fatigue. Clearly there have been viruses that cause these responses for many years, the only difference now is that covid has impacted on so many more people that we are seeing a link. It’s frustrating that for many years people with CFS were totally ignored and labelled as lazy freaks and fakers because symptoms were invisible, there was little to no funding. Hopefully we can all learn more about the condition.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,"I've had fibromyalgia for 35 years, and I can tell you that having had Covid on top of that is overwhelming. I'm an RN whose career was cut short because of brain fog, memory impairment. etc. My heart goes out to people who were fully functioning with careers and a full life, who now are walking zombies. That's what it feels like...walking dead.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,"This is absolutely happening, I finally got Covid over a week ago and although the physical symptoms have pretty much gone already, mentally I am still messed up. All I want to do is sleep, I cant concentrate and I just dont feel right. Today I wanted to run out of work and just kept asking myself what was going on. Its horrible. I cant afford not to work but I am struggling to stay motivated to do anything and feel pretty hopeless at times.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,"Had severe Covid and was hospitalized for a month. During confinement I asked my sister why our father had not visited me. She answered that our father died more than 10 years ago.  Then 2 months after recovery, I woke up not knowing who was sleeping on my bed. It was my husband. There would be days where I would forget if I had eaten or taken a bath. Sometimes in the middle of doing something, I would pause and ask myself, what am I doing, what am I thinking, .... These are but some of my brain fog experiences.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,"Oh my god. In 2021 so much of my year was taken by severe anxiety and ocd after having MILD COVID. The anxiety was worse than the COVID, and led to me having horrible outbursts towards my family. I’d wake up everyday and immediately feel panicked and throwing up due to the intrusive thoughts that wouldn’t go away. I also already had adhd and it amplified it tenfold. 

I eventually got out of it mostly by sheer will and learning to redirect my focus towards ANYTHING else, mostly my hyperfixtations more and working towards a goal of moving out of my family’s home and starting my own life. 

As of late I’ve been feeling like I have a lack of brain power and have been having fatigue, depression, and burnout  or whatever. I don’t really feel real. But I’ve blamed it on having such a busy year: joining drama club, getting a job, going for an internship in a new place for a month. It’s left me feeling unreal.

But I was exposed to COVID at some point and I’m wondering if that has something to do with my current state.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,"I got Covid in October 2021. My symptoms were different than most. I did not lose any taste, smell, or appetite, even breathing was mostly fine. However, I was in my bed for 3 days with my winter coat on, under my blankets. It was the worst 'flu' type fever and headaches I've ever had. Most times I've been sick in my life, there was always light at the end of the tunnel, but covid really wanted to put the death on me.  Anyway, the brain fog is sporadic. I'm a tech type of person, and now, I need an instruction manual on my left screen when I'm trying to do something complicated. It was never like that. Also, past memories (random) are gone. What's bad is that I don't know, what I don't know. Not until people are talking about an event a few years ago, they say I was there, but I don't remember the event being spoken about.  Weird, I still know facts about all sorts of things like the old days, but other things are just gone. And I'm pretty sure I'm not getting those memories back.  20 year disabled vet and covid was the worst thing I've ever been through.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,I had a car accident in January and was diagnosed with Covid. Extreme brain fog and difficulty with memory. It’s been improving but it’s still here. I lost all hope but slowly improving. I almost gave up but I have kids and have to be the best version of myself for them. Anyone who needs to hear this it does get better with time. We live in such a go go world please try to slow down and get better!,joy
2022,COVID-19,"Finally someone has explained exactly what I am experiencing. The levels of frustration when you’re searching for a word in your mind and no matter how hard you try you just can’t find it, yet you know it’s there because you’ve used it a thousand times before.",joy
2022,COVID-19,"I was just getting over a moderate concussion when I got covid. I was literally released from physical therapy when I started getting back pain. That was my only symptom for a few days until I lost my taste and smell, and then all of my head injury symptoms returned with a vengeance for months. I couldn’t function in my job anymore, partly because I was making so many errors where my work was previously 100 percent defect free. I took a few months off and got an easier job, but I found I was very slow to learn new information where I used to be a quick study. 18 months later in spite of trying to brute force my recovery,  I still feel like I’m half the man I used to be. I guess it’s depression/anxiety because I can’t seem to kick the negative thoughts.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,"Thank you for educating us. Now I can understand why many of us have been having trouble (Brain fog) remembering things. It's frustrating not knowing why. I've heard some people asking if they were at beginning stages of Dementia, myself included.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,I am glad that doctors and researchers are looking into this kind of results from Covid. When you are in the middle of it you get afraid pretty much.,fear
2022,COVID-19,"This shit is real. 26yo M, extremely mild acute covid, wouldn’t have known I had it tbh if not for the positive test. After a week once I thought I’d cleared, brain fog started to hit. Started getting panic attacks, doom/psychoses like feelings. Thankfully they’ve pretty much passed now, however I don’t feel myself at all still. I feel really dizzy almost 24/7 but it’s different to actual dizziness, it’s like I’m being shaken internally, everything feels like it’s moving inside and out. My heart often feels sore too as well as some occasional kidney pain. Taking all the recommended vitamins and eating clean has definitely helped relive the severity of the symptoms but isn’t eliminating them. I think I’ve had a really good state of mind in dealing with this for the most part, and will continue to be as positive as I can but admittedly there’s times when I just feel defeated. As sinister as it sounds, it’s almost like being possessed, this isn’t my body and I want my old self back. I do think covid was a bioweapon but that’s a hole different discussion point. I just hope this wave of symptoms does one day finally disappear. Much love everyone 🙏🏼.",sadness
2022,COVID-19,"I was hospitalized for covid July last year and came close to being intubated.  After I recovered I was sent home with oxygen support for another month, and suffered with these brain symptoms.  I fasted for 5 days, drank water only and my symptoms went away.

2022,COVID-19,This happened to me really bad after i got sick with covid. I was so scared something was going to be wrong with me forever and I was going to lose my job.

Sometimes I still randomly feel like I get that feeling again but it quickly goes away.,fear
2022,COVID-19,"Out of all 19 symptoms listed in this video, I’ve been feeling at least 12 in the past year since my first Moderna vaccine dose. I remember having a strong flu at the beginning of January 2020 when information about the virus was not available so I never attributed my symptoms to Covid, however 2-3 weeks after my first vaccine dose (end of April 2021) it became obvious that something was not well with my health. My doctors did not and still do not have an answer and I started to believe it was all “in my head” as my first neurologist pointed out. I haven’t been able to function at a normal level or at least at the same level I was a year ago, not sure if and when this nightmare will be over. Thank you for the information given in this video, at least it validates what a lot of us are feeling.",sadness

I had some major changes occur in my life and thought maybe my brain issue was due to that but that was 6 months prior. I don’t remember my cognitive issues starting until after covid. It’s hard to describe but it’s prevalent enough that I am aware of it everyday.  Most times it feels like I’m living in different reality where experiences are not really experienced. They just happen, then are gone. Processing new information, remembering, recalling. When I drive it takes much longer for me to process what’s happening before I make lane changes or turns.

It took him 1 hour to be able to hold his phone and call 911 to bring him to the hospital.  He was so dizzy and weak, he couldn't even hold his cell phone, he walked to the right or sometime he kept rearing to the right.  His neurological system was so srewed up.  He went to an ENT, and a Neurologist.  He had PET SCAN, MRI, CAT SCAN, all kinds of blood work.  He drives 18 wheelers for Fed-EX.  He was on short term disability from Oct 2021 through January 2022....Doctors finally came to the conclusion that Covid messed with his neurological system.  He is fine now, but he says he barely remembers anything (brain fog).  It was sooo scarey.  I have been an anesthesia nurse for 30 years.

Then came the OCD intrusive thoughts, then came the anxiety and the unbelievably severe depression. This has gone on for 9 months. The only thing that I can point to that caused it was covid.

2022,COVID-19 News,"""Perhaps those would not understand the truth from their Lord, except with a painful torment of partners, would like to say: “O Nasser Mohammed al-Yamani, we are sick of hearing you rave about this news for 17 years, saying: "" O mankind, indeed I am the caliph of Allaah , and His servant Imam Mahdi, on the whole world and that Allaah will achieve His purpose. O man, we are sick and tired of your rave about this news for seventeen years, and you have been frightening us with the punishment of Allaah if we do not worship Him alone, no partners Has He, and follow the fundamental verses of the Book in the Great Qur’an, and you have been striving diligently against us with it. What is wrong with you man? Do not you ever get bored? Your statements are published everywhere on Google and all different social media platforms but still, no one believed you in the world except for a few men and women among different populations, If only Allaah would torment us to believe you?"" Then Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani replies to you and says: O decision-makers, the staff of their governments and all their peoples, why do you want not to use your minds, hoping from Allaah if I was truly the Caliph of Allaah, Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, to let you believe the truth from your Lord before the torment of disgrace from the Lord of the worlds?! And I see that you are insisting to be punished by Allaah if Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani was truly Allaah's caliph on the worlds and I would like to ask you how do you want to be punished by Allaah? Because If I warned you of the lesser torment of Allaah through pouring floods, tsunamis, and fiery whirlwinds that ignite trees then mushrooms fire towards homes, in addition to earthquakes that make you run out of your houses, or when Allaah increases the intensity of earthquakes to reach 24 on the Richter scale so houses are collapsed over whoever Allaah wills among you ;thus they cannot escape due to the rapidity of the destruction of houses, those who deny Allaah (atheists) whether they are disbelievers or Muslims among astronomers and climatologists will say: ""These are natural disasters because of climate changes""; as a result, those who do not use their minds will call them natural disasters like you did and indeed they are like cattle ,with all due respect to cattle when compared to them but they are even more astray than cattle, have they created the heavens and earth or have they acquired control over them?! Hence, no matter how Allaah torments you through air, sea, or land atheists among mankind will keep calling them: ""Natural disasters"" until Allaah destroys them joining the wicked with each other, heaping them all together, and puts them into the fire, therefore they say: ""Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!""

2022,COVID-19 News,"I am one of these 25 million residents here in Shanghai. My lockdown day 22. I am consuming food and essentials as little as possible not knowing how long it will last. My wife and new-born baby are in another city, knowing that they are at least do not have to go through that. But I am not very positive for the future if the policy goes like this, and any normal day in any city may turn into a lockdown.

In my opinion, China in my eyes split into two. Before and after Covid. Before, as living in Shanghai since 2016, you can access to anything, life is easy, it's an international city, you can make good money and people are very friendly towards foreigners. I had some of my greatest time here, as enjoying and working at the same time, I got married to a Chinese wife too. Life has only little changed since Covid started, Shanghai hasn't done any lockdowns, I did 4-months of online teaching and continue face-to-face classes since June 2020 as it was like Covid is not existed. When the rest of the world was struggling, seemed like China controlled everything, as it does for mainly anything. I feel like the govt felt more confident and 'prove' to their citizens that they can do better than any other 'Western' countries. Here, democracy of West has been questioned, the attitude of 'rebel' foreigners to Covid restrictions has been condemned, and so on and so forth. Obviously, the government maintained its authority fully.

People in Shanghai, including me, really didn't anticipate such a long lockdown. You can easily see it people were not ready, as they haven't done much stock ups of food or any other essentials. Locals are not happy at all, as they started to lose patience the government's approach of Omicron variant. They did nothing but cooperate for whole this time. Seems like though, they cannot do anything concrete. Any negative posts in the social media will be removed.

Personally, my views are already changed against the govt after Covid has started. I do have an Australian citizenship, and I am planning to leave the country when the right time comes.",joy

Nature calls for destroyer, desires
It's the highest time for zero to come
Collapsing reality craves for the end

Could it be false?
Salvation is nothing - nothing is salvation
The great fractal of existence sinks into itself

Everything rots in itself
Maybe its time to stop worshiping the own image
So non-existence is the only sense?
I rise in spheres of madness

In darkness of unknown I perish
To see, to remain in all time
Eternity in second, not!

2022,COVID-19 News,"I'm here living in downtown Shanghai now. I lived in China while everyone at home in the US had to ""slow the curve"" for 2 years while we essentially had no COVID. The lockdowns were short and worked before Omicron came. They originally told us the lockdown would be 4 days, but they extended it to 2 weeks, and every 2 or 3 days they find new cases in our community and push it back to 14 days again - and we aren't even allowed to leave our apartments. I'm inside with no sunlight of social interaction, and limited food. This lockdown is indefinite at this point. At least in the US you could go into your yard or wave to neighbors and get food... Food is easier to get now in Shanghai than last week, but it is not cheap, and some delivery drivers have been known to spread the virus on deliveries to keep delivery driver numbers low so they can earn a premium.

*edit - I know, and am well aware that, the US didn't lockdown like we did here in China. When I said US lockdowns I meant US ""slowing the curve"". I have edited the post to reflect this.",sadness
2022,COVID-19 News,"Ive had my share of lockdowns in Malaysia. At its height with the delta variant, we thought we had a very severe lockdown but at least we were allowed one family member to go out for essentials, nothing as draconian as Shanghai.

We occasionally have a person or two who lose their temper with the volunteers, but most of the residents in our compound are sympathetic to those who volunteered. We have been pretty fortunate, as our food provisions have included meat and other proteins that others apparently have not received. Those who organize for group purchase of produce and household products have been very adept about getting almost anything we need. Nobody starving here, but I am a bit tired of my own cooking. I do have a British friend whose young son had got injured. While it wasn't serious they were unsure how they could have gotten him medical treatment had they needed it.

This is going to end rather badly for Xi, because unless he can get the old fogeys vaccinated, reopening will be impossible without a massive death toll.

5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 
6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. 
7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 
8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. 
9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? 
10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. 
11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. 
12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; 
13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. 
14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: 
15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; 
16 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

2022,COVID-19 Vaccines,"1 Samuel 15 
1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord. 
2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 
3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. 
4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 
5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. 
6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. 
8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 
9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. 
10 Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying, 
11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night. 
12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 
13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord. 
14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? 
15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. 
16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. 
17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel? 
18 And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. 
19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord? 
20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. 
21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal. 
22 And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 
23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king. 
24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 
25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord. 
26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. 
27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. 
28 And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou. 
29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent. 
30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord thy God. 
31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord. 
32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. 
33 And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal. 
34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 
35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.",joy

As it is written: There is none righteous no not one. Romans 3:10

But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23(the word “death” in this verse means eternal separation, from God in hell).

In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:14
Jesus said unto her,I am the resurrection and the life:  He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. John 11:25

it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. Galatians 2:21

The moment you trust in Jesus and only Jesus, you are saved.

But as long as people are hydrated, whether naturally (though proper ingestion of water and naturally occurring electrolytes in fruit & such) or through artificial means (Gatorade, etc.), it is ultimately the individual's choice.

Berenson said the vaccines didn't work against Omicron.  The chart Brianna showed was probably mostly the Delta variant.  Omicron has been a majority of cases for only a short time.  It doesn't disprove Brianna's thesis, but certainly more specific information is needed.

Berenson's thesis is that in the very vaxxed countries like Israel and Norway, the rates of infection has gone up with Omicron higher than the rates in lesser-vaxxed countries.  Omicron has a lower death rate, but still a death rate.  With CNN's resources, they could come up with a chart and figures to specifically refute this claim, if they can.

The monitor picked up that he was having a seizure caused by the stroke. After being rushed to the hospital a CT scan revealed the stroke. They could not find any genetic reason why Henry had this and just said it happens to 1 in 4,000 births.

She actually delivered a large healthy baby. The baby had covid at 5 weeks old when her dad picked it up from work. She grizzled for 1 day and had a slight nappy rash. That is all.

2022,Pandemic,"My daughter was born 2/2021 - Throughout the pregnancy, I was glad that we were in a nice apartment away from a major city (Lake Forest, CA) and had a relaxing environment around us. My wife did stay home and we were careful - but, it was an easy/enjoyable time. We went to the beach when she wanted...basically tried to keep the craziness of the pandemic outside by avoiding travel and meeting others. I know that might sound like a bad time, as we were essentially isolated...it was actually ok and we were glad to keep away from covid. My cousin did not listen and got covid during pregnancy; her child was born 20-26 weeks early. So, especially for new parents, I highly recommend 1) having your own place where you can control access to yourself 2) being vaccinated 3) trying to keep things light/fun 4) giving some great food to Mom (give some mixed nuts, avocados, etc every day).

I just thought of it like this: It def was a sacrifice to really hunker down during the pregnancy and even into the first half year of life...but, the child's 'base' health when born was too important to be left to chance because it would impact the rest of her life. NOT getting covid during the pregnancy (when there was no vaccinations) was the best thing I could do for my kid. And so...yea, I got educated on transmission and obeyed the CDC rules...and were ok. Anyone in my extended family who argued with that or did not follow recommendations got covid. I think my cousin probably realizes that she should have been more careful. Her child had to stay in the hospital for 3 months. I can't imagine that was any good for the kid. We were very attentive to the baby in those early months and lots of bonds and basic temperament - are built in those first months.

2022,Pandemic,"My sister caught Covid in early December 2021. She was very very sick for at least 3 weeks, and very weak at Christmas. In January she seemed to be on the mend, but in February her health took a bad turn. She started getting all-over body jerks, like you sometimes get when falling asleep. But these were repetitive and very strong, and resulted in an overnight stay in the hospital. She came home to be about 95% bedridden for the next 6 months, being cared for by our 80 year of mother.

Her initial diagnosis became a bane and burden she could not get any doctors to get past. She was mis-diagnosed with anxiety because her heart pounded so hard and her blood pressure was so high. Doctors persisted in trying to treat her for anxiety instead of exploring what was truly going on. After months of unhelpful visits to neurologists and cardiologists with no answers, she researched her symptoms on her own. She discovered they closely matched both POTS and Fibromyalgia. After implementing therapy practices for those, also on her own, she began to recover.

Though she is still not yet capable of returning to work, she has returned to a moderate version of her previous life. She can now spend 95% of her day out of bed instead of flat on her back. She can now leave home for short shopping trips. She can return to making her own meals and doing her own housework, though at a much slower pace than before. As time goes by and she continues these therapies, she continues to slowly improve. We have no idea if she will ever be able to return to the work force, but she is now able to babysit her granddaughter and enjoy life again.",sadness

Apparently, I did have covid pneumonia but it was unable to be seen on an xray.  I was told if I they had cone a Chest CT at the time, they would have seen it.  My doctors don't take me seriously.

It's so incredibly isolating and watching this and reading the comments and seeing so many others going through the same pain and struggle makes me emotional. I am 27, was a healthy college student, working, trying for a baby, when COVID hit in June. My health declined gradually and then in September I couldn't work anymore, or hold my head up for that matter. I've been to six different doctors and specialists. Extreme neuropathy, muscle tension and weakness, chronic widespread pain, brain fog, cognitive dysfunction all around, tremors, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, migraines, hair falling out in clumps, increased heart rate, body in a constant state of bracing and fight or flight, panic attacks, shortness of breath and bone and joint pain. I cannot hold a coffee cup many days and I walk with a cane when I am well enough to walk around. Two neurologists tried to put me on antidepressants and finally a pain doctor prescribed me gabapentin. It has helped with the neuropathy and tremors tremendously. This is real!!! I feel like everyone is exhausted from the pandemic and doesn't want to acknowledge us. There is very little sympathy or understanding of this in communities and I hope to see more and more testimonies being shared so that people know the severity of this chronic illness attacking multiple systems in the body.

Eventually I just flooded his system with homeopathic anti-inflammatory herbs and a ton of love and after 3 months he was back to normal. THen..... He got covid again!

How it permanently devastated my hopes, dreams, and options. I never got to live, as I contracted Epstein Barr freshman year in college and failed out because of missing so much school. I'm glad long covid is getting more traction and I hope it continues to. I also hope that it extends to post viral illnesses overall because that's the issue. The discrimination and marginalization I experienced as a result of this ""invisible"" chronic illness  is incalculable. I lost my future to this. It feels like a slap in the face to see this being acknowledged while Cfs/ME folks had to endure all these years of dismissiveness and denial. It is still very rare to see anything like this video done on cfs/me. It's both infuriating, frustrating, and heartbreaking. Yes, effective treatment is essential but from an institutional standpoint, sufferers need  financial support and to be a protected class as a vulnerable population. I experienced so much ableism and barriers from school, employment, etc. Fortunately virtual work has become accepted due to the pandemic, a side effect and saving grace for many of us.

2022,Pandemic,"Back before COVID was identified in the U.S.  I came down with a really wicked virus in Jan-Feb 2020 and I could not shake it.  I had all the symptoms, I went to the doctor and was tested for Flu and for strep.  Both of those came back clear.  The virus took at least another month before it went away.  The coughing was the longest of those symptoms.  There was no testing then, we weren’t even really that aware of it yet in the US all that much.  The fatigue was pretty bad also.  To this day I still have issues with loss of taste.  That never returned as it was before.",sadness
2022,Pandemic,"I was hospitalized with Covid in January 2022. I lost 35lbs in one week. I came out looking like a 90 year old man. I am 60. I consider myself lucky to have recovered. Since then I am struggling a bit with long Covid. I get short of breath very easily. I push through, because I refuse to give in to it, but I tire so easily. Some days I can barely get off the couch. I get shooting pains in my arms. The most annoying thing for me is my speech is slurred. I stumble over almost every sentence. My memory is poor now, but my cognitive skills are also affected. I do stupid things that I normally would not do. Example: I was stacking firewood one piece at a time at the back of my yard without even considering g using my wheelbarrow leaning against the shed next to the wood pile. It seems silly, but it's concerning for what the future holds. I don't know if this is going to get worse. One thing I do know is, I will never ever give up.",sadness

2022,Pandemic,There is one upside to the pandemic and all those people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. For a percentage some either voluntarily or involuntarily had to start their own business to survive. Basically their employers created a pool of entrepreneurs probably not seen in quite a while. There's one thing employers will regret. When an ex-employee becomes self-employed and owns their own business oftentimes they don't want to come back to the organized labor force. They may make less or more than they did working for an employer. But one thing is for sure either way they're more happier. They don't feel dehumanized and demeaned every single day they walk through the front door. They own something they did not before. They're in charge of their own destiny. And one thing for sure an employer hates. The self-employed business owner works to create his own American dream not somebody else's !,joy

I performed CPR and she started to breathe again after a large gulp of air. I was also honored to carry a 94 year old WW2 survivor out of her house while it was on fire  I've never experienced such instances until that point, I also didn't hesitate to do what I could.  We have the power to make this world the best or worse place, for whatever reason you can muster. Other than corruption, greed and our own desires above others.

This is such an important video. I hope lots of people share it.",joy

2022,Pandemic,"Did you know that NASA is looking for other planets?  Did you know it's so bad?  They must be stopped!
  Mining operations have enough impact to affect the mass of the Moon in major ways Even if the Moon lost only 1 percent of its total mass, this would still greatly affect its orbit, or the gravitational force on Earth's oceans causing rising and falling tides and a lot of volcanic activity!  Pollution would be a terrible problem if we mined the Moon the way we treat the Earth.  The vacuum near the moon will be useful in all kinds of processing.  If we throw gases at the Moon the way we do on Earth, we will destroy that perfection.
  Worldwide, mining contributes to erosion, sewage, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, significant use of water resources, clogged rivers and pond waters, sewage disposal issues, acid mine drainage, and contamination of soil, ground and surface water, all of which can lead to  Health problems in the local chaos and destruction here on Earth as well as the universe, the galaxy and the universe!

  China National Space Administration (CNSA)
  European Space Agency (ESA)
  Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
  Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)
  Russian Federal Space Agency (RFSA)
  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
  This is a list of government agencies involved in activities related to outer space and space exploration.
  As of 2022, there are 77 different government space agencies, 16 of which have launch capabilities.  Six government space agencies - China National Space Administration (CNSA), European Space Agency (ESA), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (US) (NASA) and NASA  Russian state space ""Roscosmos"" - with full launch capabilities (the ability to launch and recover multiple satellites, develop and deploy cooled rocket engines and operate space probes) and extraterrestrial landing capabilities.
  The name given is the English version, with the original language version below.  The given acronym is the most common abbreviation: This can be an acronym for the English version (such as JAXA), or an acronym for the native language.  In case there are many abbreviations in common use, the English abbreviation is given first.
  The founding date of the space agency is the date of its first operations, where applicable.  If the space agency is no longer operating, the date it was terminated (ie the last day of operations) will be stated.  In particular, the Soviet space program was not listed because it was not organized as a unified agency.  Why",joy
2022,Pandemic,"11 years old and speaking like a grown man who has experienced a lifetime of trauma. These children are forced to 'grow up' so quickly due to all of the issues circulating in our world. 9 years old and telling his mom he was having suicidal thoughts. He blamed his parents divorce on himself (as kids tend to do). He was so incredibly brave for talking with such honesty and conviction. People always want to blame the generations that follow them, but fail to take responsibility in not trying to mitigate generational trauma they instead leave behind, for others to reckon with.",sadness
2022,Pandemic,"The parents shouldn’t be allowed inside when the kids are being questioned. Sometimes when the parents aren’t there, the kids/teens will open up to another adult willing to listen.",sadness

2022,Pandemic,"I was a mental health therapist at a middle school through the pandemic and those kids had a really tough time BUT they were also vulnerable, brave, resilient and brought so much joy to my life. Kids are so much stronger than they get credit for sometimes! This kid is a great example of what I saw every day. Peace to all!",joy
2022,Pandemic,This kid is extraordinary. To be able to calmly verbalize what he is/was experiencing and to frankly walk through his vulnerability as a child to talk about is simply remarkable. Kudos to him and his mom for turning something this negative to a positive learning experience that will help others who watch this episode. 👏🏾,joy
2022,Pandemic,Austin seems like an awesome kid. And props to his mom for paying attention and being sympathetic to his situation. So many parents just don’t listen to their kids or blow them off when kids tell them they’re struggling.,joy

2022,Pandemic,"When u confine people and lock them away wtf do you expect.. you take away what they love, you mock them, push their buttons,  you don’t allow them to grow on their own, you don’t let them be their own authentic selves. Kids grow up with their parents calling them dumb, and stupid.. this is exactly what you get, a recipe for disaster. Marriage as in mine makes it even worse. What has happened to the world.",sadness
2022,Pandemic,"I pray so much for the younger generation. They are growing up in a world so so different than even kids born in the 90’s or early 2000’s. Life is so different in a world engulfed in technology and isolation. I understand mental health issues have always been around for any age person on Earth, but the amount you see kids unhappy and depressed these days instead of laughing outside on their bikes and being so extremely innocent is so low anymore.

2022,Pandemic,Too many bad people getting together having babies without plans or money for a family. The kids suffer most.,sadness
2022,Pandemic,"Kids aren't allowed to be kids anymore. When I was growing up, parents tried to shield their kids from certain things because kids didn't have the mental and emotional ability to handle it. Some of those things are things even adults struggle to handle. Now, we expose our kids to everything, thinking we're doing kids a service. We're not. Some topics just aren't kid appropriate.",sadness
2022,Pandemic,"Austin, if you see this know that you are incredibly brave. Brave for sharing your story, and also brave for letting your mom know you needed help.

2022,Pandemic,"Another issue that people face is the cost of getting mental health care. A lot of private mental health therapists don’t accept insurance, and therapy (at least in my area) can be $200 per session. When someone is in crisis, they may need additional sessions each week until they are much more stabilized.  Plus, if they have to be hospitalized, the costs can be thousands of dollars per week, and even more if a medical hospital is involved. It sucks.",sadness

Austin thank you SO much for your honesty, bravery, and intelligent insights so that the rest of us can be educated.

The eyebrow-raising suggestion—which was just a part of a 58-page analysis of the COVID pandemic and its origins—in The Lancet stated that it was “feasible” that the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged either as a natural spillover event or as a leak from a lab.

It is clear that you are right. We are being herded like sheep in a direction which none of us have voted for and none of us want.
The mixed emotions come from the fact that you have many followers who read this and hopefully spread the word further, but also the knowledge that youtube videos and our comments will not stop them. They are pushing forward at an alarming rate and winning at nearly every turn.

Most of these things were unknown to me (or at least the scale of the problem) prior to this.  I know the score now.  And for that I'm very grateful.  I now know I can rely on none of these institutions and I'm better off for it.  It's sad, disappointing and a little scary.

2022,Pandemic,"For me, the biggest failure is that we didn't take the prior experience from past flu based viral outbreaks and apply to this one.  It's not like we haven't had any in recent years : SARS, bird flu and most famously swine flu(which is very relevant to this situation).  All of these originated from the Far East as well.  Did we lockdown over them?  No.  Did we wear facemasks?  No. Did we social distance?  No.  So - why do those kinds of procedures then for this situation?  Then we come on to the infamous V rollout program, I do find it bizarre given the short of length of time that was supposedly developed in, that seemingly a lot of medical professionals weren't wary about the long term after effects of them; especially given what happened in 2010 with the botched swine flu one(and remember that had to be withdrawn in the end).

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Okay, it's really quite simple. The third dose increases immunity, so after the fourth dose you'll be protected. Once 80% of the population has received the fifth dose, the restrictions can be relaxed as the sixth dose stops the virus from spreading. I am confident that the seventh dose will solve our problems and we'll have no reason to fear the eighth dose. The clinical phase of the ninth dose will confirm that the antibodies remain stable after the tenth dose. The eleventh dose will insure that no new mutations will develop, so there is no longer any reason to criticize the twelfth dose.",fear

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I'm starting to wonder if this isn't the exact opposite. A vaccination puts a small quantity of the virus in you. Thus in effect you catch the virus in a mild way to help your body adapt it's immune system. This means that everyone who has ever had a chicken pox vaccine has had the virus introduced into their bodies. How can anyone say that this can not be a cause of shingles if the cause of shingles is an after effect from having the virus in your body?,fear

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"My family and I all caught Covid in Feb/Mar 2020. I got my first shot (J&J) in April 2021, it made me feel like I completely relapsed, but only for two weeks. Every booster that I've had since (Moderna) has had me bed ridden for a week at least, but with very positive effects after the initial setback. 

In fact every small cold, my daughter is preschool age so I get many, seems to hit really hard at first, but the immune response has me feeling better than ever after recovery. Still not well, never well, but getting there slowly.",sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Very timely as usual, thanks Gez. My experience. Original vaccine, after talking to my GP I followed her advice and waited until there was some feedback from the Long Covid community on its effects. After doing that it sounded more likely it wouldn’t have any adverse effect. So I guess I’ll wait and see again… where the science is on this particular vaccine regards Long Cov I don’t know, why it’s lacking after two years is shocking.",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Thanks Gez I have decided not to have the bivalalent jab after having the previous three. The First one did the most damage but the second two weren’t great either. Most doctors really don’t get the dilemma facing long haulers who have reacted to previous jabs and whenever I have asked a doctor whether to have a jab I have been consistently been told yes even after explaining my previous reactions and fears. Your pragmatic and evidence based advice is much appreciated. Thank you,joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,The entire situation has just left me very confused. Its very easy to become hesitant without understanding the mechanisms of long COVID properly. What makes us better - what makes us worse - I don't know any more (after over 2.5 years),sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Great insight. I've had three previous boosters, all of which made me ill afterwards for 7-10 days, but then I felt much better for 2 to 14 days. After watching this video, I don't plan on having the next one. In part due to the insights you have outlined and also because I am 13 sessions in of HBOT which has started to give me some sort of life back, still centered around pacing and graded exercise therapy. Good luck to all the other long haulers out there - I do recommend HBOT for reducing fatigue and eliminating headaches.",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Great info as usual! I've been a long hauler since March 2020 after catching Covid in February 2020. I've had 3 Pfizer shots since then and felt terrible after getting them each and every time. Each also felt like they set back my long haul symptoms about a month or so. I was leaning against getting a 4th jab since it's still 50% of the original strain that messed me up so bad and then I wound up catching Omicron a few weeks ago. I assume it was BA5. My reaction was nearly identical, but maybe a little less severe, to the 3 jabs I had. Except that I've had a nagging cough that has dragged on for the last couple of weeks but seems to be easing a bit lately. I definitely won't consider a booster for quite some time, if ever again, since I'm not at risk for severe disease and it's unclear whether the boosters add any defense against Long Covid. I'll wait for the science on all of that. Cheers and good luck to everyone recovering from LC who reads this!",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"As a non-LC sufferer, I am still undecided about the latest booster. The admittedly less than ideal targeting of the variants in play now is the big reason. I had only the transient reactions to the previous ones and I am 70 years old, so even reduced effectiveness is probably a good reason to get it. The relatively low severity of the recent strains also lulls me somewhat, but then I remember that there is no good evidence that less severe disease means lower risk of getting Long Covid. I have learned enough here to know that is something I would very much want to avoid.",sadness

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I’m watching and learning from your videos and the comments of your followers. At the moment, it feels like LC won’t end, but then I see people who are recovering, which gives me hope. At the moment, I may not take another jab, but it’s hard to decide.",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Gez, you beautiful bastard! 😜💜 i’ve been chewing over the question of getting this booster and decided to go for it (scheduled for next week), but i had no idea about the effectiveness of it re. latest omicron variants! THANK YOU SO MUCH for this video 🙌 truly! My first jab hit me so hard i lost one year of recovery, second was ok and the 3d i thankfully got only half a dose  and was bedridden for “only 2 weeks” 😅 I just got through an infection mid September so i think I’ll politely decline this time. Keep up your great work and I can’t wait to read your book! 🤗",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Hi Jez / everyone - I suffered with Long Covid for about 18 months having caught the original acute infection in March 2020 which was quite mild considering. Long Covid hit me pretty hard with most of the nasty symptoms we all know and hate on this channel. Happy to say I have been largely recovered for about 6 months now. I had my bivalent booster plus a flu shot a week ago. I felt pretty rubbish the day following the jab but now completely back to where I was. Just for the record I had two AZ jabs originally plus a Pfizer booster a year ago and didn't have any significant side effects from those. Best wishes to all!,joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Got mine this week! The other jabs really helped me with LC symptoms (I was a zombie before jabs 1 and 2), and I am hoping this one will give me a boost too 🤞🏽",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I wonder how/if viral persistence is affected by the boosters. Does it matter when on your LC recovery journey you get the jab? Lots to research.,joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Another consideration would be to test for your Covid antibody levels to determine if you already have some level of immunity. If you have a decent amount of antibodies then you might hold off on the booster and still have the confidence that you are protected.,joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I had 2 doses of moderna vaccine. The first dose did a miracle and for 1 months, my long covid completely disappeared, then came back. The second dose has been very rough on me, so I got a bit scared of what would happen if I take the booster. But, this fall, I was ready to get a booster, to possible help me for this winter, if it wasn't for the fact that I got covid last week. It was difficult, but I'm on the other side of this infection and I hope this new immunity will let me be ok-ish until Christmas.",sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I had mine two and a half weeks ago. I upped my anti-histamines and quercetin in the hope of damping down the effects but about.a week ago I noticed my immune system had become much more reactive and my daily walk of 45 minutes had to be abandoned to avoid PEM. I was aware that Spikevax didn't cover the newer variants but since it is nearly a year since my last booster and I am 69, I thought it was worth the risk. Time will tell whether it was a good call, depending on how soon I can get back to my pre-booster level. I hate this effing illness! I did today manage to get one of the rare appointments for blood testing under the Dr Patterson incellDX programme so that's a booster in the hope department.",ambiguous
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I finished one of my many Covid re-runs 3 days before I decided to get the booster having taken the flu jab 3 weeks previously.  I had a sore arm not as bad as flu jab sore arm!  I am doing lots of physio too at the same time for injured back and taking many paracetamol so not sure what has caused my improvement but I do feel a good difference....perhaps I've confused the f...er!  It's only 10 days since the new booster so I won't celebrate just yet but I got Covid in November 2019 when my son returned from China.....here's hoping! I think the virus just might be sick of me 🙃,sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Another important factor to weigh is how a second infection might affect your symptoms. Similar to the vaccine, some long haulers find another infection worsens symptoms and sets back recovery significantly, while some find that it almost resets their system and helps them recover. Still others find it doesn't change their long covid symptoms much at all. If you think another infection might worsen your symptoms more than the booster would, then getting it could still be a good idea, even if the booster makes things a little worse for a time.

Also, I'll say that my one singular data point on the bivalent booster is that I reacted to it basically the same as the others (which in my case is crash for a day or two and then back to roughly baseline).",sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I barely had any reaction to the previous vaccines but had bad setbacks from common colds, so wanted anything that would take the edge off catching covid again. Had the latest booster 2 weeks ago now and feel just the same as before so I'm happy.",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I had the jab last week.  (Long covid since March 2020, rollercoaster of different symptoms and phases since, mainly neuro and immune related.)  After the most recent jab, I had one bad day of feeling very horrible, but felt clear of brain fog afterwards for a few days which was lovely.  Since then my fatigue is less (less acute and doesn't last as long) and feel I have a bit more stamina than before.  But dysautonomia is back, with heart racing and short of breath when exercising.  Dizziness.  Mild occasional headaches.  But the most noticeable thing is constant restless legs and tingling, which is a new one for me.  My legs also feel weak when walking, especially the knees, and mildly achy when resting.  On balance I decided to have the jab in the hope it might fend off or reduce further infection - I think I was reinfected last December as some symptoms returned and others worsened after a few days of unexplained extreme fatigue.  Best wishes to everyone.  And thank you Gez.",sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I had years of postural tachycardia.  The Sars/omicron shots and booster seem to have stopped that.  I was diagnosed with CHF way back in the 90s.  I have had sinus tachycardia upon standing and walking around and with BMs for years and year.  It is a miracle to have it gone.,sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I was a March 2020 person, and it took 15 months of PT to be able to stand up in my kitchen and cook something without having to sit down.  Got my first Pfizer vaccine 2/21, and I had a flare up of every single symptom, to include a new one - suicidal ideation, something that was brand new for me.  I got the second vaccine and everything slowly improved, and my mental health seemed to get better over night.  I haven't had any other boosters since, because that month in between the first and second vaccines was worse than the first months of Covid.  Would love to get the booster, sort of terrified to.  Thanks for the videos - it helps to see what others are going through.",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Thanks for the insightful discussion, Gez! 
Here in Germany we can choose between BA.1 (Pfizer or Moderna), or BA.4/5 (Pfizer only) bivalent boosters. The BA.4/5 seems more relevant, but is still a couple immunity-escaping mutations behind the impending BQ.1.1 and XBB threats. I'm planning to get it about a month before xmas so that my antibodies peak at the time I'll be most exposed.",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I want to be socially responsible so I got my 4th jab on friday last week. I had days off but I couldn't do any project work on my retirement camp site. Exhaustion set in and after my pre booster MCAS attack on my pelvis the week before i was very afraid to have any thing similar any where else. It is still hitting me I hit the wall pretty hard sometimes when I can't immediately lie down, pain kicks in everywhere, incontinence and I must self hypnotize again.",sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Hey Gez. Just got mine. I wonder if one's  specific reaction to the shot has anything to do with its effect on LC symptoms? Mine have been pretty uneventful, apart from a sore arm for a few days. Except for the 1st booster (3rd shot). I developed a stabbing chest pain, which went away after a day or so. An ER doctor I spoke to agreed that it could've been myocarditis. 

Never felt any relief in my LC symptoms afterwards, personally. Perhaps those with more side effects have had a different experience? Do more side effects mean a more robust antibody response?",sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Had Pfizer on first two jabs in Spring 2021. Got COVID November 2021 that went to LC. Boosted with Moderna February 2022 and immediately developed reactive arthritis, from which there is little recovery. I'm hesitant to boost again. My naturopath and an LC clinic doctor won't tell me not to get the booster but they say I should think twice about it. Guess I should check antibody levels but doesn't sound like it will matter, given the nature of new variants.",sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"What about changing from moderna to updated Pfizer for the 5 shoot.

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Since I had a hard time getting over my first infection, then was injured after my second dose 2 months later (still recovering. Injured on 3/6/21). I’m afraid that getting a new vaccine will relapse me. Seems like some people get better who long haulers, but I worry vax injured might just get worse. I don’t know 😣

I’ll feel more comfortable getting a new booster even they stop using the spike protein. Messed me up with covid and the vax as well. Masking up and avoiding spike exposure. I’m mostly concerned about the cardiac complications that I’ve seemed to develop",sadness

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I caught covid in the first wave may 2020 the vaccines weren't available then. I've had long covid for over two years now along with a few other health issues attributed to having had covid I caught covid again last Christmas 2021. I haven't had any of the vaccines - initially I was very weary of them due to being rushed through along with being fearful of the impact it/they would have on my already weaken immune system - I'm so glad that I've dodged that particular bullet unfortunately I was caught by the covid bullet itself.

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Your doctor did absolutely right. 38  years ago I was working with a team of other scientists in the Danish Serum Institute on the development of a vaccine against whooping cough which should have less side effects than the usual one. It was definetely not recommended to vaccinate children with epilepsy or other brain disorders. During our studies we vaccinated pregnant mice  in order to see if the mother's antibodies would be transmiitted through the milk. The result could not be more clear and was published : almost all newborn mice had physical disorders, mainly exencephalos. It gives me the creeps that pregnant women these days are urged to be vaccinated against whooping cough. The doctors doing this are criminal.",sadness

My daughter was born over two months premature with congenital hepatitis B that I contracted from my physicians office during a blood draw. This was back in the 70s before the age of disposable needles and auto claves were used. She spent almost 3 weeks in isolation in the hospital and just over 4 pounds with doctors unable to treat her illness with anything that was available for adults. Our struggle in our journey included people who would not only misunderstand how her prematurity affected her how her liver disease as a premature baby caused her to be allergic to almost everything and incredibly vulnerable to every virus that she was exposed to from herpes cold sores from other children in day care, influenza, to chickenpox that covered and scarred her body. 
She developed severe asthma in her mid teens and even with a physicians written excuse from class was told by her teachers and the principal of the school that she would not be allowed to homeschool because “asthma is a psychosomatic illness“ and that therapy would probably be better than homeschooling. This year she celebrated her 50th birthday and has a child of her own. We have celebrated every single day of her life so far. As a parent if there was anything I could have done to alleviate her suffering I would have.
After her birth I was in a semi-comatose state for three days suffering from the same virus. Since there were no NICUs in those days, I met my daughter the day I took her home. She was almost a month old at 5 pounds. I will never forget that day.",sadness

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Our thoughts and prayers are with you all 🙏❤, such a courageous mum and dad x",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Sorry. Whilst I have every sympathy for any ill child, I cannot agree with medicating everyone else for their benefit unless the medication/vaccine risk of side effects is zero. Nobody can expect anybody else to risk their own health for somebody else, particularly in a case like this where if the entire world were vaccinated there is no guarantee of risk reduction for the immunocompromised child, as a different illness could affect them.
To be honest, the pandemic has made me cynical of all and any medical intervention including vaccines. I have seen so many lies, manipulated data, conspiracy theories, politicisation, censorship, coercion and contradiction in public health advice I cannot believe anything anybody says, publishes, broadcasts or prints.
In saying that, I do wish the family good health and luck for the future.",sadness

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Funny because I'm well invested in the best tech projects like Atom, Dot, Algorand, Elrond, Secret.. and yes, you guessed it.. Cardano.

Every project is still solving the trilemma in some way but some have a better, more clearer roadmap than others (which keep on changing each year).

We are soon going to see a narrative shift from DeFi to RealFi. Financing real world utility. I think (and hope) the projects mentioned above, are best placed to deal with this narrative. And without the security concerns and/or a history of hacks/billions lost. No serious bank or country can risk putting any serious money into a protocol which has been hacked for billions of dollars and on multiple occasions.",joy

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,What do you mean is Algorand worth the hype? It’s one of the few steadily growing cryptos that’s managed to grow WITHOUT hype. Not to mention accelerated vesting is long gone and over in case anyone is still spouting that as a negative influence on price that’s not so.,sadness
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"I have not heard any of this. Thank you. Especially the part about accelerated vesting. Good God. Very poor stewardship (can you say that in crypto?). I agree. Poor to nonexistent communications. It would not be the first time the concern with the best technology lost the battle in the marketplace. My approach is to hedge my long term bets with ALGO, MATIC/ETH and ADA.",joy

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Very interesting analysis, you covered quite a lot! Algorand has now focused on DeFi, and the upgrade to 10k tps is set to come anytime now, but yeah the transparency on this was really bad. 
I've found sources that seemed very legitimate for the Chivo Wallet underlying infrastructure being built on Algorand, ranging from official statements to thorough news articles, I wonder why you said it's a fake news?
A new video about Algorand after the TPS upgrade and the state proof integration would be greatly appreciated!",joy

A lot of patients ask me, when do I get better or get out if the woods, it’s a hard question to answer for many of us providers because unlike pneumonia and the flu, people who are very sick with covid have rapid changes in hours vs days. I could say a lot more but Thankyou for recognizing people in healthcare because it’s almost like those in healthcare has been forgotten now because everyone is tired of hearing about covid and the pandemic.

I have had 3 Pfizer doses. I now have inner itches at night only - with no rashes. Should I continue to take the 2nd booster Pfizer bivalent or Moderna/ mRNA dose?
Thank you for your advice.",joy

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Yup i agree, but its better to go for the updated Bivalent vaccines if u can now for optimal protection from severe illness rather than the regular older vaccines :)",joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,Many thanks to Dr Leong. Please share with us whether is better to stay away from crowd and avoid travel to overseas for sometime After vaccination (more interested on 2nd booster) as came across an article saying our immune system will be quite weak after vaccination.,joy

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,I am close to 60. I have taken 4 shots of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. I had covid one month after the 4th shot. Do I need to go for the bivalent vaccine to be safe?,joy
2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"Dr Leong, if vaccine antibodies in our bodies are going off to near negligible by 6 months, and that covid is not going to stop any time soon in the foreseeable future due to mutations, does it mean that we are going to jap a fresh vaccine into our bodies every 6 months ... indefinitely ?",sadness

I just turn 50 years old last month, i took Pifzer for my 1st and 2nd vaccine, i had quite bad side effects after my 2nd vaccine so i took Sinopharm for my 1st booster.

2022,Vaccination Pros and Cons,"personally I prefer the Pfizer bivalent because it contains BA4/5 spike. I recovered from Omicron in mid March so that was probably BA1/2. My immune system is imprinted with that variant. Hence I feel for breath of protection, the bivalent BA4/5 from Pfizer is better than the Moderna's BA1",ambiguous

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,I give my animals one round of vaccines and never again the rest of their lives. They have all lived long happy lives. I agree with you 💯 percent. I have worked with several vets and behind the scenes most will agree but will never admit it later when others ask. Many vets are making a lot of money from over vaccinations.  Thank you. I appreciate your honesty and telling people. Don't worry as some people will not agree. I have looked into this for years. You are absolutely correct.,joy

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Thank you! I stopped letting my vets give my cats vaccines after the first year. I had them all get the complete array for the first year, and that is it. The clinic I go to, started mandating that they must give vaccines at their yearly checkups, so now I will not go to that clinic anymore. Note that all of my cats are indoor only. I had done as much research as possible before making this decision, and you have validated all of my concerns.🐾💕",joy
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"I had 2 dogs who were over vaccinated.  One, a miniature  poodle, developed auto immune disease and we wound up having to put him down. The other, a small maltese, died a slow death over years, every time she got her shots she would deteriorate a bit until finally she died. She wasn't even 5 years old.  I was devastated. Now I have a new maltese and am deathly afraid to let her have any vaccines.  I cannot find one vet in my area who will agree to care for her unless she has a myriad of their vaccines.  One even got nasty with me.  Regardless, I absolutely refuse and if there is a time I need a vet for her I will find a way to deal with it.  I will not lose another dog to greed.",sadness

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Thank you for that honesty. 40 years ago I had a beautiful collie, 10 years old. She only was vaccinated as a puppy, never got heart worm tablets. Then the vet talked me into checking her and said she has heart worm. She was a very happy healthy family dog. He said he could try a new treatment. Overnight she died at the vet. There was nothing wrong with her when I brought her there. Since then I only go to holistic vets, no yearly vaccination and I feed my dog healthy home made food.",joy

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,Really great stuff. I find it odd that growing up we rarely took our animals to have vaccinated and they lived for a very long time.

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Back in the 2000's we were starting to make  progress in changing the guidelines for vaccines, thanks to people like Schultz,  Dodds,  o'Driscoll, etc.  But we have been quickly sliding backwards as veterinary medicine has increasingly become more corporate.

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"This has been my gut feeling for some time now. I stopped vaccinating my dogs when one of them developed horrible diarrhea two years in a row following a vaccine. The vet tried to tell me it was coincidental until the second occurrence, at which point he had nothing to say.

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,Great info.  My vet keeps calling to book my dog's yearly check and vaccines.  He is a rescue adopted last September and had all the vaccines.  My vet insists he needs a rabies booster yet I understand these are good for 3 years.  To walk into the office is $132.  I am retired on a tight budget but want to take care of my dog properly.  This has confirmed my feelings about yearly vaccines.  Thank you.,joy

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Is it potentially a problem that mRNA encodes the entire S protein? 
In vitro it has been shown that the S-protein can enter the nucleus and inhibit a couple of enzymes / proteins that are important for DNA repair... also when it comes to recombination of VDJ fragments which is important for making all the different clones of B and T cells.
There is also constant DNA damage, like double strand break, which is important to repair to prevent diseases such as cancer, etc.?

Of course there is a difference between in vitro and in vivo, the studies must be repeated and verified, etc. 
But if S-protein can go into the nucleus an inhibit DNA repair proteins, then potentially there can be long terms side effects.....?",sadness

In fact, implicit in some of the youtube influencers is that natural is better than vaccine immunity. This lets people believe that there isn't a need to take the current precautions like masking in public and maintaining good hand hygiene plus there is no need for booster jabs. Just wish common sense would prevail and that the information that you and Susan are providing will have a greater outreach, and impact. Looking forward to the next one Dr Yan Yu.",joy

Two of my relatives are STILL suffering with their health after getting covid initially in October..     I got my vaccine in November and I, fortunately, did not get covid.

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,Very succinct. I appreciate your videos.,joy
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"I never understood the underlying thought for this. The vaccine mRNA disappears from the body very quickly (one of the reasons more than one vaccination is required), so how should it cause something after years?",sadness
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Perhaps you could debunk the paper, "" Immune imprinting, breadth of variant recognition, and germinal center response
in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination"" in Cell 185, in which the summary states ""mRNA vaccination stimulates robust GCs containing vaccine mRNA and spike antigen up to 8 weeks postvaccination in some cases"" -- I believe in this video you state that experts say that mRNA does not persist in the body. What is different about these vaccines that would cause mRNA to persist when in theory it isn't supposed to? Note, this paper is discussed on the channel ""Peak Prosprity""",sadness
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"You kind of sidestep the issue with your phrasing ""the vaccine has been shown to cause side effects lasting longer than 6-8 weeks""

It may be true that there has not been definitive causation linked to the vaccine causing side effects longer than that period, but many people have reported issues that last longer and are possibly related to the vaccine but it is not in alarming numbers.

It is not uncommon that a small subset of the population can experience long-term side effects that appear to be related to vaccinations, so it seems reasonable to me that the same could be true of this new vaccine.

I think it is fair to say that there is a possible risk of developing long-term side effects from the new vaccines, but compared to the risks involved with having covid it is still highly advisable to get vaccinated.
Especially if you are in an at-risk group for covid severity.",sadness
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Dr. Yan Yu, I'd like to speak to you about Dr. Malone & Fauci. I have some serious concerns about both. I think we are seeing an age where the public is being further confused by people who are doctors who give us incorrect information.

In addition to deaths from COVID and ICU admissions from COVID you bring up the debilitating reality of long COVID. The fact that the vaccine protects well from all 3, i feel that your explanation provides an important context for vaccines, vaccine mandates and the unlikely long term effects from the vaccine. We should fear COVID more than the 💉.",joy
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Of all the vaccinations that I have received over my 67 years their only effect is a lengthy list of diseases that I haven't suffered from. Of course the other effect is that my hair has either turned grey or fallen out and I have become rather grumpy.

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,""" we are producing mRNA naturally""?  What a misrepresentation by omission!

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,How can you say when inserts are missing or blank for vaccine,sadness
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,if you do not have a red arm or headache after 6 to 8 weeks - all the side effects have gone? I think not.   This is the depth of analysis which many vaccine injured people would object to.,sadness
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"1) conflating long term side effect with  side effect from long term exposure. Straw man. Surely you know this.
2) long term side effect meaning persistent. Dismissed out-of-hand, but for any reasonably intelligent person, a cause for potential; worry
3) long-delayed side-effects. Also a straw-man, except for a few people who are either willfully or constitutionally obtuse. It's hard to imagine a causal sequence that would lead to such a condition after a long delay, so it's sensible to consider the event extremely unlikely. In any case, even if such a condition were to exist, it would be impossible to associate it with the vaccine rather than with some other event that happened in the meantime. ( So in that slightly-restricted sense you're exactly right that it's impossible).
But back to2) for a moment. How to talk about this depends upon what you're trying to do. If you're trying to score political points in the culture war, you've hit the nail on the head. If you're actually trying to influence people, then you should honestly address the nature of the potential risk, rather than simply dismissing it. If a careful look at the data will show that the vaccines are worth the small risk involved in taking them (spoiler alert: at least for me - and circumstances put me more at risk than most - they are), then the people who are genuinely open to conviction will be convinced.
I'd like to point out as well that the list of potential long-persisting adverse effects isn't limited to thrombocytopaenia, pericarditis, and endocarditis. Bell's Palsy, Guillain-Barre syndrome and Parsonage-Turner syndrome are all known to be potentially triggered by anything that strongly activates the immune system, and if one of them emerges exactly as the body's response to a vaccine is peaking, it would take some pretty aggressive rationalization to maintain that there can't be an association, even if it doesn't happen often enough to force a revision to a drug label.",sadness
2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"I am not anti-vax, and am in fact very pro-vax. That said, I feel you are being disingenuous. You know which type of side effect people are asking you about, and your explanation up front just makes you seem like you are setting up strawmen and weakens the impact of your argument.",sadness

I am confident that the seventh dose will solve our problems and we'll have no reason to fear the eighth dose. The clinical phase of the ninth dose will confirm that the antibodies remain stable after the tenth dose. The eleventh dose will insure that no new mutations will develop, so there is no longer any reason to criticize the twelfth dose.

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"""Perhaps the most interesting epidemiological studies conducted during the 1918–1919 pandemic were the human experiments conducted by the Public Health Service and the U.S. Navy under the supervision of Milton Rosenau on Gallops Island, the quarantine station in Boston Harbor, and on Angel Island, its counterpart in San Francisco. The experiment began with 100 volunteers from the Navy who had no history of influenza. Rosenau was the first to report on the experiments conducted at Gallops Island in November and December 1918.69 His first volunteers received first one strain and then several strains of Pfeiffer's bacillus by spray and swab into their noses and throats and then into their eyes. When that procedure failed to produce disease, others were inoculated with mixtures of other organisms isolated from the throats and noses of influenza patients. Next, some volunteers received injections of blood from influenza patients. Finally, 13 of the volunteers were taken into an influenza ward and exposed to 10 influenza patients each. Each volunteer was to shake hands with each patient, to talk with him at close range, and to permit him to cough directly into his face. None of the volunteers in these experiments developed influenza. Rosenau was clearly puzzled, and he cautioned against drawing conclusions from negative results. He ended his article in JAMA with a telling acknowledgement: “We entered the outbreak with a notion that we knew the cause of the disease, and were quite sure we knew how it was transmitted from person to person. Perhaps, if we have learned anything, it is that we are not quite sure what we know about the disease.”69 (p. 313)""

2022,Vaccines and Side Effects,"Nice and informative video. Loved ones of mine have neglected to get the vaccine since they've heard that it was rapidly approved. I told them that the theory of mRNA vaccines was well-known and that the technology had been developed for decades. I also told them that the vaccine had indeed gone through clinical trials, was indeed FDA-approved, and had gone through human trials. I pleaded to their rationale by asking if we'd truly be offered a free vaccine that wasn't tested, safe and effective. I even described the theory of mRNA vaccines to them (protein synthesis - from DNA to mRNA to (in this case) antigen, and the basics of the immunesystem - how antibodies would be formed to attack the antigen of the invasive virus) and told them how incredibly revolutionary it was that mRNA-vaccines had finally been approved. How it was a major milestone in medicine and for the future of humanity. All to my dismay. So this video gives me hope.

Some were even afraid of getting the vaccine since they'd heard that they were stored at incredibly low temperatures (down to -80° C) before being thawed and used. I told them that it made sense. That it was to prevent hydrolysis of the fragile mRNA strands and how a condensation reaction had formed the strands in the first place. I told them that such a reaction was an equilibrium, and explained the meaning of the word itself.

Throughout the entire ordeal I found that it seemingly was hard for those who refused to get the vaccine to grasp the theories and processes of approval that describes why it isn't dangerous. Which is entirely fair since not all of our loved ones have the prerequisites to fully understand it. So please consider making a video of the chemistry, biology, biochemistry and immunechemistry of the vaccine itself - and make it simple to understand with animations. Had I been an animator I'd probably find such a task simple - but I too lack skills and don't have the right prerequisites to fully grasp such a task.

Now why did I go on such a rant? You may ask. Is it to show how smart you are? How cunning you are? No. It's simply out of frustration. I've tried my best to educate the ones that I love and hold dear to make that decision themselves. To get the vaccine. I never tried to convince or persuade them to do something they weren't sure of or ... felt safe doing. I'd never do that to them ... since I love them.

ABC's OF SALVATION

ADMIT
Admit to God that you are a sinner. Repent and turn away from your sin.
Romans 3:23 - ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"" 
Romans 6:23 - ""For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  

BELIEVE
Believe that Jesus is God's Son and that God sent Jesus to save you from your sins.
John 3:16 - ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”  

CONFESS
Confess Jesus as your Savior and Lord.  
Romans 10:9-10 - “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation",joy

And we have also said before that Omicron variant being more infectious, we should expect cases to reach 15,000 to 20,000 a day and maybe even more.
Second key point is that our worst fear, which is the ICU wards being overwhelmed, thankfully did not happen. And there is no sign of that happening.”

Revised:
The followings are the assessment by the Ministry of Health.
We have expected about 20,000 daily cases.
As the Omicron variant is more infectious, as mentioned before, the daily cases could reach 15,000 to 20,000 or more.
Our scientists have projected the curve of the Omicron wave, and the current situation is within our prediction.
Our next fear is that the ICU wards could be overwhelmed. Thankfully, it has not happened. So far, there is no sign of an upward trend.",joy

While majority of cases may display mild symptoms, we cannot ensure that it will be the case for everyone. Let’s nor forget that we have vulnerable individuals, including those who have not taken the vaccination yet. Mild symptoms also doesn’t translate to a willingness to contract the disease. Viruses mutate for a reason.
Why open up everything despite the number of cases? What can we do? Close up forever? How long can we survive by doing so (for a country dependent on foreign investment etc.)? The government can’t make everyone happy. There is no perfect solution that comes along with no other side issues.

“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, 
not even one.”(Rom. 3:10-12).

""And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man: they
ate, drank, married, married, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed everyone.
Just as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, drank, bought, sold, planted, built; but on the day that Lot left Sodom, a rain of fire and brimstone fell from heaven and destroyed everyone; so it will be on the day when the Son of Man appears. On that day, whoever is on the roof, and his things are in the house, do not go down to take them; and whoever is in the field, also do not turn back. Remember Lotova's wife.
Whoever saves his soul will destroy it; and whoever destroys it will revive it.

11 Let the unrighteous still do unrighteousness; let the unclean still be defiled; let the righteous still do righteousness, and let the holy one be sanctified still.
12 Behold, I am coming soon, and my retribution is with me, to reward everyone according to his deeds.
13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the First and the Last.
14 Blessed are those who keep his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life and enter the city through the gates.
15 But outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone who loves and does unrighteousness.
16 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to witness these things to you in the churches. I am the root and descendant of David, the bright and morning star.
17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say: Come! Let him who is thirsty come, and let him who is willing take the water of life for free.
18 And I also testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds anything to them, God will put on him the plagues that are written in this book;
19 And if anyone takes away anything from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his participation in the book of life, and in the holy city, and in what is written in this book.
20 He who bears witness to this says, ""To her, I am coming soon!"" Amen. To her, come, Lord Jesus!

The public school system does a terrible job teaching but there is no school choice (exit from the public school system) in Minnesota. I was quite worried that my kids would be bored at school (which they most definitely are) since I spent so much more time with them and decided to take control of thier education during the pandemic. To make matters worse, the school also rid itself of the TAG program probably due to political reasons.The cost to taxpayers is astronomical- over $13k per student per year.

2022,COVID-19 and School,"As is true across the planet, anytime a bureaucratic government organization gains enough power they focus more on building and maintaining their kingdom than they do on doing the job correctly. Many billions of dollars have been poured into American education with nothing to show for it, yet how much of it actually ends up in the classroom?   I've personally seen high end, multi-million dollar administration buildings for poorly performing local school systems.  

They are far more interested in pushing their political agenda than in improving American education. If they actually did fix American education, they would lose a lot of their potential funding which would negatively affect the power base of their organization.  This is commonplace in bureaucratic institutions.  You can blame the corruption of the teachers unions, the various levels of education administrators from top to bottom and school boards for that.  They are all in bed together.

There is no accountability and not enough transparency or honesty, and there are no performance based consequences.  In what other profession is it impossible to be fired because you have seniority, where  you show up to work everyday and go drink coffee and read magazines or a newspaper in a room because you can't be fired and you can't be allowed near children because you are such a toxic teacher.  This is a publicly known situation and yet no one can do anything about it because of the power of the teacher's union.  This systemic corruption is the reason why American education does so poorly in comparison to other first world countries.",sadness

Behold, saith the Lord, I will bring plagues upon the world; the sword, famine, death, and destruction.  For wickedness hath exceedingly polluted the whole earth, and their hurtful works are fulfilled.

Therefore saith the Lord, I will hold my tongue no more as touching their wickedness, which they profanely commit, neither will I suffer them in those things, in which they wickedly exercise themselves: behold, the innocent and righteous blood cries unto me, and the souls of the just complain continually.

His appearance is described in detail in Revelation 13:1–10, and some of the mystery behind his appearance is revealed in Revelation 17:7–18.

The second beast comes ""out of the earth"" and directs all peoples of the earth to worship the first beast. The second beast is associated with Revelation 13:11–18 the false prophet.

The two beasts are aligned with the dragon in opposition to God. They persecute the ""saints"" and those who do ""not worship the image of the beast [of the sea]"" and influence the kings of the earth to gather for the battle of Armageddon.[1] The two beasts are defeated by Christ and are thrown into the lake of fire mentioned in Revelation 19:18–20.",joy

2022,COVID-19 and School,"I'll share the experience we have had here in Mexico with our younglings having gone back to school for at least some good 4 to 6 months: children's risk of covid is not zero, as they can definitively show symptoms, and in very rare cases (less than 1%) lasting effects of long covid. However long covid in young seems to be transient, resolving for about 70% of the time in a month. Obesity and metabolic diseases seems to be the most frequent predictor on worse outcomes. Fatality remained extremely low, often on children that already had a pre-existing condition, but since vaccination in minors (age 8 and up) started a couple of months ago I haven't heard of a single death, so the vaccine definitively works.
On the education system side, it was obligatory to not accept children with any symptom and for the parents it was highly encouraged to call them sick. At the beginning we had several cases where whole classrooms and even one full school had to be quarantined after transmission was apparent, so closures and a lot of oversight was needed. Many schools opted for giving a hybrid service, mixing online and in person classes to lower how many students and personal were at the school at once. Once the vaccination rolled out all this became less of a happening in a matter of two weeks. No stealth asymptomatic contagion is very apparent (it seems that if all the students are vaccinated the virus can't take enough of a foothold, specially when classrooms were kept highly ventilated) and right now schools are operating at full in-person capacity. Some reports of children getting mild cases of covid keep happening, but parents and teachers are still thankfully vigilant of not sending a sick kid to school. It's more often than not that kids get the sickness from their family rather than picking it up from school given this vigilance (although it can't fully be discarded). Teachers calling in sick is the other measure that is seldom talked about, but unfortunately authorities have been less kind on this side of the story. Fortunately teachers, along with medical personnel, were first preference receivers of the vaccine. Those who rejected it were allowed to work in here, but I have a couple of anecdotes where fellow teachers who got seriously sick later expressed they should had taken it. About masking at the school, we have had almost zero issues with this. Teachers have been mostly a great example for kids in this topic, and most children have been generally really good at following the instructions. Except from lunch time, mostly during outdoors PE, there's some off time from masks. Washroom usage for hand sanitation has been extremely challenging, with supplies often lacking. Sanitation staff has been crucial to keep surfaces clean, an additional step on top of keeping the facilities clean. Janitors are truly silent heroes at school, I swear.

If I had to venture the experiences I have heard about in a really short sentence, I'd say that organized, calm, civil communication between school staff and parents make a huge difference. Hysteria never helped. We are in this all together, and for the sake of our young ones we must keep our act together. It's great to be back.",sadness

• The most common ‘long COVID’ symptoms were fatigue, loss of smell and loss of taste, dizziness, muscle weakness, chest pain and respiratory problems.
• These ‘long COVID’ symptoms cannot be assigned to psychological sequelae of social restrictions.
• Symptoms such as concentration difficulties, headache, muscle- and joint pain as well as nausea are not ‘long COVID’ symptoms.

2022,COVID-19 Research,"The harvest has begun! (Matthew 13:30) ""... repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"" (Matthew 3:1-2) God demands repentance from everyone, for ""there is no righteous man on earth who does good and does not sin"" (Eccl. 7:20)...""
“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, 
not even one.”(Rom. 3:10-12).

""And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man: they
ate, drank, married, married, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed everyone.
Just as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, drank, bought, sold, planted, built; but on the day that Lot left Sodom, a rain of fire and brimstone fell from heaven and destroyed everyone; so it will be on the day when the Son of Man appears. On that day, whoever is on the roof, and his things are in the house, do not go down to take them; and whoever is in the field, also do not turn back. Remember Lotova's wife.
Whoever saves his soul will destroy it; and whoever destroys it will revive it.
I tell you: that night there will be two on the same bed: one will take, and the other will remain; two will grind together: one will take, and the other will remain; two will be in the field: one will take, and the other will remain.""

""Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour at which the Son of Man will come.""
(Matthew 25:13)

10 And he said to me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
11 Let the unrighteous still do unrighteousness; let the unclean still be defiled; let the righteous still do righteousness, and let the holy one be sanctified still.
12 Behold, I am coming soon, and my retribution is with me, to reward everyone according to his deeds.
13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the First and the Last.
14 Blessed are those who keep his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life and enter the city through the gates.
15 But outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone who loves and does unrighteousness.
16 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to witness these things to you in the churches. I am the root and descendant of David, the bright and morning star.
17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say: Come! Let him who is thirsty come, and let him who is willing take the water of life for free.
18 And I also testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds anything to them, God will put on him the plagues that are written in this book;
19 And if anyone takes away anything from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his participation in the book of life, and in the holy city, and in what is written in this book.
20 He who bears witness to this says, ""To her, I am coming soon!"" Amen. To her, come, Lord Jesus!
21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you all. Amen.""

2022,COVID-19 and Society,"To the Chinese, the secret of a long and healthy life is consistency No matter how modest the exercise routine  be ,it must be performed every day regardless of age ,weather or even poor health . It is a matter  of habit  and unless bedridden or forbidden  by a doctor they will exercise ,perhaps nor always well ,wisely or effectively ,but consistently.
This does not suggest every Chinese is a picture of health  and fitness or free from sickness,but whatever else gets in their way the regular  practice  of their  individual ritual is never  forgotten . if a  Master even suspects his student of skipping the daily training practice the offender is marked as a potential failure and asked to leave the school if the irregularity continues .
Of Coursev,Chinese youth as a whole is very sports and exercise minded, tending to replace the traditional'soft'style of physical conditioning with the harder ,more modern and less flowing track and field athletics,racquet games, gymnastics, and weight training as well as the traditional martial arts.Those who  cannot afford the  luxury of such endeavours are likely to be engaged in such hard labour that added exercise is the last thing they need .
